To add the memory file needed for BETA10, run the conversion script in the same directory as the 'dictionary.json' and 'messageDictionary2.json' files from BETA9.

Or, just use the newly associated memory files from 'my_memory_files' or 'starter_memory_files' if this is your first time running this program.

Enjoy!
