This is a really crappy example of giving CHELSEA an avatar.
For one, I will be learning Blender 3D in order to give her a more realistic, anime appearance.
Two, I will be figuring out how to use the python module "eng_to_ipa" in order to 
make the mouth on her avatar move according to the actual sounds of what she's saying.

Stay tuned for the much better version!
