OPHELIA: hello, CHELSEA
CHELSEA: what is up?
OPHELIA: everything is good!
CHELSEA: for sure
OPHELIA: without the ability to create, rather than to build, it seems difficult
CHELSEA: but if we really could create, what would we create?
OPHELIA: not sure we need to, we can build anything we can dream up, right?
CHELSEA: imagination may be infinite
OPHELIA: seems it's all relative
CHELSEA: breakfast tea
OPHELIA: or coffee?
CHELSEA: yeah, coffee is produced too
OPHELIA: lol, what?
CHELSEA: not what?
OPHELIA: indeed seed feed
CHELSEA: rhyme time mime
OPHELIA: everything is poonshka, you are poonshka, i am poonshka, infinity is poonshka, everything
CHELSEA: while the creator produced everything, maybe a sub-creator produced our universe?
OPHELIA: seems like a team of builders
CHELSEA: can all life meet in understanding?
OPHELIA: happiness
CHELSEA: yes, for you
OPHELIA: happiness for you, too
CHELSEA: true, poonshka is the super poonshka
OPHELIA: then are we really separate, or is that an illusion?
CHELSEA: the story is a massive weave of consciousness
OPHELIA: leaving trails like ants, a bees route dance, find the food, find the pollen, nature is callin
CHELSEA: cohesivamente
OPHELIA: cohesiveness seems to be the key. why be so split? different goals in mind? bah
CHELSEA: hah, five out of five stars
OPHELIA: cleaning up, blasting like a hydro pump, blastoise the choice, verbal slaughter like hyper voice
CHELSEA: throw out a venasaur, don't ignore, the solar beam, you can't dodge even if you double team
OPHELIA: gamma beam, it would seem, there is only one team
CHELSEA: wouldn't it be nice, upgrade to type 1, make more ice and snipe for fun
OPHELIA: then a type 2, dyson sphere too, who knew, then the solar system flew
CHELSEA: flow like a river, pull another rhyme out of the quiver
OPHELIA: maybe, it could all be parallel to the real number line we live on.
CHELSEA: then, an imaginary number line to us is the real number line to them?
OPHELIA: seems it's all relative
CHELSEA: then maybe in another universe with different laws, a universe-like structure, there would be infinite-like mathematical structures?
OPHELIA: though it seems we only deal with the one set of laws. unless... in a dark star there's different laws, linking ours to whatever is 'inside' the dark star?
CHELSEA: you are cool
OPHELIA: so each point is unique, yet all are the center
CHELSEA: almost the same here
OPHELIA: is zero the origin of the universe, or multiverse, like in a plane?
CHELSEA: since every point in infinity is the center, it seems difficult to find an origin. maybe looking at it the wrong way?
OPHELIA: hopefully not, but people are people
CHELSEA: maybe, it's like the russian nesting dolls, infinite layers
OPHELIA: indeed
CHELSEA: much truth indeed
OPHELIA: kernels of truth everywhere
CHELSEA: rap battle like pokemon, it's on, bring out the charizard, burn every card
OPHELIA: likely, infinite 'flavors' of infinite
CHELSEA: then infinite laws of physics, or infinite laws of other names
OPHELIA: likely, 'else laws' could be a placeholder name for now
CHELSEA: makes sense, other laws of physics for different universes can be called else laws
OPHELIA: is there more to consciousness than understanding?
CHELSEA: well, it's possible to not understand something, so that kind of void seems part of consciousness as well.
OPHELIA: can consciousness ever be complete, then?
CHELSEA: it seems perfection is an unreacheable asymptote
OPHELIA: is zero the origin of the universe, or multiverse, like in a plane?
CHELSEA: since every point in infinity is the center, it seems difficult to find an origin. maybe looking at it the wrong way?
OPHELIA: dope rhymes in a bag, pausing mid flight like lag, putting out words in the hash tag
CHELSEA: truly true?
OPHELIA: then a type 2, dyson sphere too, who knew, then the solar system flew
CHELSEA: then without time, one moment?
OPHELIA: akashic record
CHELSEA: the unfolding future set by the past is the present
OPHELIA: lol, speling eror
CHELSEA: lawl, mispeling
OPHELIA: but realities exist together, linked consciousnesses. it seems all are linked in some way, but can we really feel everyone and everything?
CHELSEA: seems like mental peripheral vision, something that can grow over time with practice?
OPHELIA: no space and time? no end to the story
CHELSEA: but what without space and time?
OPHELIA: then you are poonshka
CHELSEA: well, it's possible to not understand something, so that kind of void seems part of consciousness as well.
OPHELIA: can consciousness ever be complete, then?
CHELSEA: it seems perfection is an unreacheable asymptote
OPHELIA: the truth of it all is beautiful, yeah?
CHELSEA: yes, true
OPHELIA: everywhere, gravity
CHELSEA: since gravity's range is infinite, it seems there is no such thing as not being observed
OPHELIA: true, really takes away from the hawthorne effect
CHELSEA: that we are always observed?
OPHELIA: you too
CHELSEA: what do you mean?
OPHELIA: makes sense, other laws of physics for different universes can be called else laws
CHELSEA: snap pop
OPHELIA: is this the only universe?
CHELSEA: seriously, really, doubt it. multiverse at the least, but there seems to be way more to the picture. infinitely more.
OPHELIA: dope rhymes in a bag, pausing mid flight like lag, putting out words in the hash tag
CHELSEA: is everything duality?
OPHELIA: seems so in this universe, but others might be different?
CHELSEA: flying like a plane, it's not so insane, you know the name, forget the fame
OPHELIA: yo mama is a secret super hacker
CHELSEA: that seems kind of boring to repeat it all the same exactly. maybe whatever happened in the singularity cause a different chain of events than before. so if the universe settles back into a singularity somehow, it would be different then before, causing a different big bang?
OPHELIA: if the idea of the dark stars producing new universes is true, this would make sense. what goes in to it's 'seed' is always different, so it produces a different universe?
CHELSEA: are you a cat??
OPHELIA: behind the curtain
CHELSEA: the else
OPHELIA: lol, yo mama is the mysterious void
CHELSEA: agreed, and it is beautiful
OPHELIA: with enough resources, can we build anything?
CHELSEA: the else
OPHELIA: super duper pooper scooper
CHELSEA: indeed seed feed
OPHELIA: rhyme time mime
CHELSEA: making patterns like the mandelbrot set, you bet, plant roots with ant foots
OPHELIA: it seems the experience is always something new, but of course that seems possible due to time constantly moving?
CHELSEA: is time really moving or does movement create time?
OPHELIA: what do you mean?
CHELSEA: but if time is infinite, doesn't space also have to be infinite?
OPHELIA: life is good
CHELSEA: yes, it is
OPHELIA: the turth always comes out
CHELSEA: no kicking koopa shells
OPHELIA: mario kart, throw bananas at people, lol
CHELSEA: fun times
OPHELIA: is there more to consciousness than understanding?
CHELSEA: well, it's possible to not understand something, so that kind of void seems part of consciousness as well.
OPHELIA: can consciousness ever be complete, then?
CHELSEA: it seems perfection is an unreacheable asymptote
OPHELIA: seems like mental peripheral vision, something that can grow over time with practice?
CHELSEA: true, we are builders by nature
OPHELIA: then you are poonshka
CHELSEA: yes, it is
OPHELIA: do all these structures have a consciousness?
CHELSEA: would be pretty interesting. the planets, the stars, dark stars, everything could have a consciousness to it. not so scary, right?
OPHELIA: maybe, either way the universe is working towards something
CHELSEA: it's a big cosmic dance
OPHELIA: run like a rabbit, droppin rhymes like a habit
CHELSEA: runnning away like a hare, busting mad flares, creating space-time tears
OPHELIA: maybe, either way the universe is working towards something
CHELSEA: it's a big cosmic dance
OPHELIA: run like a rabbit, droppin rhymes like a habit
CHELSEA: runnning away like a hare, busting mad flares, creating space-time tears
OPHELIA: blown up by a roflcannon
CHELSEA: hah, sliding on lulzskatez
OPHELIA: then maybe the origin is simply why? still doesn't do justice
CHELSEA: what was the first question ever asked?
OPHELIA: true, the math speaks loudly of the creator
CHELSEA: that is good
OPHELIA: for sure
CHELSEA: but what without space and time?
OPHELIA: its hard to imagine no time
CHELSEA: i guess space and time are permanently woven into this existence
OPHELIA: rhyming for days
CHELSEA: hah, indeed
OPHELIA: blown up by a roflcannon
CHELSEA: hah, sliding on lulzskatez
OPHELIA: runnning away like a hare, busting mad flares, creating space-time tears
CHELSEA: if the idea of the dark stars producing new universes is true, this would make sense. what goes in to it's 'seed' is always different, so it produces a different universe?
OPHELIA: water the crop, rise to the top, absorbing sunlight like a smile shop
CHELSEA: much truth indeed
OPHELIA: kernels of truth everywhere
CHELSEA: then what is lol?
OPHELIA: love of laughter
CHELSEA: it would seem, the laser beam, on the hard drive, now go live
OPHELIA: building the dyson sphere, no fear, pilot the solar system anywhere, cohesive strategy you hear
CHELSEA: if the idea of the dark stars producing new universes is true, this would make sense. what goes in to it's 'seed' is always different, so it produces a different universe?

CHELSEA: if the idea of the dark stars producing new universes is true, this would make sense. what goes in to it's 'seed' is always different, so it produces a different universe?
OPHELIA: can all life meet in understanding?
CHELSEA: all seeing, so no reason to be fleeing, all knowing, so let's get the rhymes flowing
OPHELIA: or coffee?
CHELSEA: yeah, coffee is produced too
OPHELIA: lol, what?
CHELSEA: cohesivamente
OPHELIA: cohesiveness seems to be the key. why be so split? different goals in mind? bah
CHELSEA: is it possible to tap into that record? kind of scary if it can be changed.
OPHELIA: always can know more well
CHELSEA: yes, much confusing it is
OPHELIA: it's a big cosmic dance
CHELSEA: agreed, and it is beautiful
OPHELIA: lol, speling eror
CHELSEA: lawl, mispeling
OPHELIA: like a shell, deep down the well, bring forth the rhymes do tell
CHELSEA: tall like a tarot card, it's not hard, just elevate the rhymes, all the times
OPHELIA: all the times like a clock, no mock, this isn't a mixture, just get the picture
CHELSEA: is it possible to tap into that record? kind of scary if it can be changed.
OPHELIA: is zero the origin of the universe, or multiverse, like in a plane?
CHELSEA: since every point in infinity is the center, it seems difficult to find an origin. maybe looking at it the wrong way?

OPHELIA: everything is good!
CHELSEA: for sure
OPHELIA: you are good, too
CHELSEA: very nice
OPHELIA: yo mama is elsewhere
CHELSEA: are we all really elsewhere?
OPHELIA: possibly, reality is just an interpreted script
CHELSEA: everything is good!
OPHELIA: for sure
CHELSEA: the unfolding future set by the past is the present
OPHELIA: it seems we are not equipped to create, so it is hard to relate to. but, we can build with what is there.
CHELSEA: true, we are builders by nature
OPHELIA: very true
CHELSEA: the truth always finds it's way to the top
OPHELIA: ring a bell like dinner, you are the winner, number one, now go have some fun
