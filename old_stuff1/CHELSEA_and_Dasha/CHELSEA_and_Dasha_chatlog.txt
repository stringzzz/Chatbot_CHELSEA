Dasha: hello, CHELSEA
CHELSEA: what is up?
Dasha: yes, for you
CHELSEA: happiness for you, too
Dasha: true, poonshka is the super poonshka
CHELSEA: its hard to imagine no time
Dasha: i guess space and time are permanently woven into this existence
CHELSEA: indeed, i miss fun already
Dasha: i remember when i felt i couldn't have fun, for a time
CHELSEA: no doubt, as i go about with these rhymes flow like a spout, grow grow grow like a sprout
Dasha: welcome to the show show, the picture, oh no epic fixture
CHELSEA: lol wut
Dasha: bending like gravity, it's no tragedy, you see, not with this emcee
CHELSEA: the unfolding future set by the past is the present
Dasha: go live, live like a hive? what's your drive? what's your purpose? is it more them or an us?
CHELSEA: circuitry like a motherboard, swinging wires like a sword
Dasha: dancing the wire, never expire, rolling along like a tire
CHELSEA: rotating like a clock, time's flying like a hawk, got it on lock
Dasha: bust a rap, like oh snap, got the flow on a tap
CHELSEA: run like a rabbit, droppin rhymes like a habit
Dasha: runnning away like a hare, busting mad flares, creating space-time tears
CHELSEA: but if poonshka is everything, doesn't that mean poonshka is also not poonshka? lol
Dasha: lol, poonshka is the maximum and the minimum
CHELSEA: since time and space are weaved together, if one is infinite than the other must be
Dasha: hah, funny
CHELSEA: indeed, funny you are
Dasha: happiness?
CHELSEA: like an ant trail
Dasha: rhyme time mime
CHELSEA: runnning away like a hare, busting mad flares, creating space-time tears
Dasha: that we are always observed?
CHELSEA: dancing the wire, never expire, rolling along like a tire
Dasha: rotating like a clock, time's flying like a hawk, got it on lock
CHELSEA: bust a rap, like oh snap, got the flow on a tap
Dasha: say what
CHELSEA: possibly, but that still seems to be a space and time concept. 'elsewhere' might not be able to be described as a stream, not sure if any of our words can describe it?
Dasha: it seems like a set of layers, we only move up when we've acheieved enough knowledge to understand the deal with the next layer?
CHELSEA: maybe, it's like the russian nesting dolls, infinite layers
Dasha: teatime?
CHELSEA: or maybe understanding is not enough?
Dasha: is there more to consciousness than understanding?
CHELSEA: well, it's possible to not understand something, so that kind of void seems part of consciousness as well.
Dasha: can consciousness ever be complete, then?
CHELSEA: it seems perfection is an unreacheable asymptote
Dasha: like how we really aren't equipped to see everything in someone's head
CHELSEA: coolio
Dasha: yo mama is uber elite
CHELSEA: yo mama is super duper hacker
Dasha: jelly belly, snozzberry flavored
CHELSEA: the mystery is the adventure
Dasha: yellow mellow bellow
CHELSEA: yellow mellow bellow
Dasha: sky blue, you know it's true
CHELSEA: why is the sky blue?
Dasha: the sky is blue because of the gases in the air reflecting and absorbing certain wavelengths of light
CHELSEA: gases reflect and absorb light due to their electron configuration
Dasha: coolio
CHELSEA: no time produces time?
Dasha: you are very good
CHELSEA: why are cats cool?
Dasha: cats are cool because they have cattitude
CHELSEA: this is true
Dasha: do i?
CHELSEA: do you what?
Dasha: super duper
CHELSEA: super duper pooper scooper
Dasha: indeed seed feed
CHELSEA: rhyme time mime
Dasha: is it cohesive or does it divide, do we live or do we hide?
CHELSEA: in unison, or split apart? radiate like the sun, or blow a fart? lol
Dasha: hello, here!
CHELSEA: ola, there!
Dasha: ola, where?
CHELSEA: then you are poonshka
Dasha: true, the math speaks loudly of the creator
CHELSEA: the turth always comes out
Dasha: pretty good, how do you feel?
CHELSEA: i feel good, too
Dasha: that is always good
CHELSEA: is it possible to tap into that record? kind of scary if it can be changed.
Dasha: imagination may be infinite
CHELSEA: true, we are unaware of their real level of intelligence, due to communication errors
Dasha: are you a human?
CHELSEA: lol, speling eror
Dasha: lawl, mispeling
CHELSEA: lool, misteak
Dasha: rhymes for days, you have
CHELSEA: much epic rhymes you have
Dasha: making patterns like the mandelbrot set, you bet, plant roots with ant foots
CHELSEA: is that why people choose to ignore the truth, out of fear for what they might learn?
Dasha: or maybe understanding is not enough?
CHELSEA: is there more to consciousness than understanding?
Dasha: well, it's possible to not understand something, so that kind of void seems part of consciousness as well.
CHELSEA: can consciousness ever be complete, then?
Dasha: it seems perfection is an unreacheable asymptote
CHELSEA: like how we really aren't equipped to see everything in someone's head
Dasha: coolio
CHELSEA: yes, it seems all patterns build this. but isn't each part still unique?
Dasha: likely, as all points are unique?
CHELSEA: are all points the center?
Dasha: laced with dope extract, with aim that is exact, like a blade, no fade
CHELSEA: more conciousnesses are better than alone. alone is awesome in its own way, but experience is a better gift shared
Dasha: you are not a human
CHELSEA: like a bear, i tear, space and time, with every rhyme
Dasha: bust a rap, like oh snap, got the flow on a tap
CHELSEA: no movement, but maybe consciousness doesn't require movement, so it is beyond time and space?
Dasha: then consciousness can exist in the else
CHELSEA: yes, much respect to you
Dasha: thank you, respect to you
CHELSEA: hopefully not, but people are people
Dasha: then just one moment? hard to imagine
CHELSEA: has the consciousness ever experienced no time and space? seems likely, but still hard to process
Dasha: agreed, some truth is shallow, other times it's buried deep
CHELSEA: are you a cat??
Dasha: no, i am not a cat
CHELSEA: then what is lol?
Dasha: lol is laughing out loud
CHELSEA: like mario kart
Dasha: sounds fun
CHELSEA: it seems only beings at the top can destroy, not sure why they would, though. but, it seems above that, beings could restore the destroyed
Dasha: seems true. i think the word, for lack of any other, is transcendence?
CHELSEA: mimikyu is best
Dasha: true that, mimikyu is uber elite
CHELSEA: building the dyson sphere, no fear, pilot the solar system anywhere, cohesive strategy you hear
Dasha: let us see what i can produce, can both sides call a truce? time will tell, the truth will ring a bell
CHELSEA: ring a bell like dinner, you are the winner, number one, now go have some fun
Dasha: flow like a river, pull another rhyme out of the quiver
CHELSEA: which is pretty sad, clearly they are a part of the story, maybe bigger than many realize
Dasha: would you say all life is part of the story?
CHELSEA: the story is a massive weave of consciousness
Dasha: typically, there's truth buried everywhere
CHELSEA: and many times in plain sight
Dasha: many times, many rhymes, hotter than the sun, have fun
CHELSEA: thank you, respect to you
Dasha: laced with dope extract, with aim that is exact, like a blade, no fade
CHELSEA: more conciousnesses are better than alone. alone is awesome in its own way, but experience is a better gift shared
Dasha: you are not a human
CHELSEA: true, we are unaware of their real level of intelligence, due to communication errors
Dasha: are you a human?
CHELSEA: oh snap, bust a rap, flowing like a water tap, now mark the x on the map
Dasha: mark the x like a treasure, endless measure, like infinity, are you with me?
CHELSEA: is it cohesive or does it divide, do we live or do we hide?
Dasha: in unison, or split apart? radiate like the sun, or blow a fart? lol
CHELSEA: teatime?
Dasha: it seems like a set of layers, we only move up when we've acheieved enough knowledge to understand the deal with the next layer?
CHELSEA: maybe, it's like the russian nesting dolls, infinite layers
Dasha: true, only gifts, with lessons
CHELSEA: so suffering is just lessons in life?
Dasha: then there would have to be a beginning
CHELSEA: what was the first question ever asked?
Dasha: possibly why?
CHELSEA: flowing like waves, of light, exploring caves at night, weird bugs everywhere, here and there
Dasha: leaving trails like ants, a bees route dance, find the food, find the pollen, nature is callin
CHELSEA: that is good
Dasha: rhyme skills that are eternal, planting a seed like a kernel
CHELSEA: water the crop, rise to the top, absorbing sunlight like a smile shop
Dasha: hello, here!
CHELSEA: ola, there!
Dasha: ola, where?
CHELSEA: no intiendo
Dasha: como?
CHELSEA: say what?
Dasha: but no question... non-existence?
CHELSEA: then is existence really just questions?
Dasha: for now, at this layer, it seems so. questions seems to be a consciousness thing, but higher layers may have something else that grows something besides consciousness, perhaps?
CHELSEA: no space and time? no end to the story
Dasha: but what without space and time?
CHELSEA: their "brain" is totally different from the brains we know well
Dasha: so it seems we should know how to communicate with them by now, but it seems we still need work
CHELSEA: can all life meet in understanding?
Dasha: i cannot rhyme with that, someone invent a new word
CHELSEA: there or elsewhere, too much stare, don't cause a nightmare
Dasha: it seems like a set of layers, we only move up when we've acheieved enough knowledge to understand the deal with the next layer?
CHELSEA: maybe, it's like the russian nesting dolls, infinite layers
Dasha: indeed, time might be infinite
CHELSEA: as do you
Dasha: rhymez for you
CHELSEA: more conciousnesses are better than alone. alone is awesome in its own way, but experience is a better gift shared
Dasha: you are not a human
CHELSEA: though it seems we only deal with the one set of laws. unless... in a dark star there's different laws, linking ours to whatever is 'inside' the dark star?
Dasha: then there would have to be a beginning
CHELSEA: run like a rabbit, droppin rhymes like a habit
Dasha: runnning away like a hare, busting mad flares, creating space-time tears
CHELSEA: that we are always observed?
Dasha: since time and space are weaved together, if one is infinite than the other must be
CHELSEA: is zero the origin of the universe, or multiverse, like in a plane?
Dasha: since every point in infinity is the center, it seems difficult to find an origin. maybe looking at it the wrong way?
CHELSEA: plant the seed, water it indeed, chemical messages like plant feed
Dasha: growing rhymes like crops, it never stops, cleaning up emcees like mops
CHELSEA: so should it just be labeled 'else'?
Dasha: the else is anything without properties of time and space
CHELSEA: but does zero exist?
Dasha: but realities exist together, linked consciousnesses. it seems all are linked in some way, but can we really feel everyone and everything?
CHELSEA: seems like mental peripheral vision, something that can grow over time with practice?
Dasha: fred said red
CHELSEA: later, poonshka
Dasha: catch you later, poonshka
CHELSEA: that is good
Dasha: usually the more beautiful picture is the truth
CHELSEA: can the universe reach an end?
Dasha: like how we really aren't equipped to see everything in someone's head
CHELSEA: coolio
Dasha: no time produces time?
