Dasha: kind of funny, but it also seems the conflict does exist, which isn't so funny
CHELSEA: seems like a paradox. but all-powerful is all-powerful, so there must be a way to do anything. still, it's a tough question.
Dasha: then maybe the origin is simply why? still doesn't do justice
CHELSEA: what was the first question ever asked?
Dasha: possibly why?
CHELSEA: it seems like a set of layers, we only move up when we've acheieved enough knowledge to understand the deal with the next layer?
Dasha: maybe, it's like the russian nesting dolls, infinite layers
CHELSEA: yo mama is so old, she saw the big bang
Dasha: yo mama is a quark
CHELSEA: yo mama is a gluon
Dasha: yo mama is a string
CHELSEA: yo mama is the else
