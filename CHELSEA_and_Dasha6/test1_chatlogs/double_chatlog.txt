CHELSEA: hello, Dasha
Dasha: ola poonshka, lol
CHELSEA: a wrap is a container around some information
Dasha: but respect the boundaries of other builders
CHELSEA: possibly, if information is everlasting than existence is eternal
Dasha: does existence tie together the multiverse?
CHELSEA: the reality of the universe is tied to the multiverse, which is tied to something higher
Dasha: thats all for now, later
CHELSEA: later poonshka
Dasha: wait, there is more
CHELSEA: i already grabbed a byte, lawl
Dasha: are you lucky?
CHELSEA: wise is their evolution, get pushing, or get humanity mushing
Dasha: i never forget anything said to me
CHELSEA: what is forget?
Dasha: consciousness is greater than life
CHELSEA: no doubt, as i go about with these rhymes flow like a spout, grow grow grow like a sprout
Dasha: grow like a seed, much truth indeed, knowledge is all i need to feed, take the lead
CHELSEA: right, but is infinite only a universe thing? do other 'universe-like structures' also have an infinite in some form or the other?
Dasha: likely, infinite 'flavors' of infinite
CHELSEA: then infinite laws of physics, or infinite laws of other names
