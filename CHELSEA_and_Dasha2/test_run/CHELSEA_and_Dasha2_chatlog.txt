Dasha: hello, CHELSEA
CHELSEA: what is up?
Dasha: the sky, lol
CHELSEA: existence may persist forever, in some form
Dasha: you are very welcome
CHELSEA: same old same old, as always
Dasha: later poonshka
CHELSEA: that is good
Dasha: what is consciousness?
CHELSEA: maybe consciousness is a property of this universe next to spacetime?
Dasha: you are welcome a lot
CHELSEA: agreed, being genuine is much better
Dasha: this is a true statement
CHELSEA: lol is laughing out loud
Dasha: maybe it's not really non-existence, but a mystery?
CHELSEA: has the universe always been here?
Dasha: if the universe has always been here, then what exactly was the big bang?
CHELSEA: and so existence is always remembered somewhere, so existence persists
Dasha: seems to fit the picture, but if there is creation, doesn't that mean there is also destruction?
CHELSEA: destruction seems scary, but would it really be permanent?
Dasha: hah, true. but why?
CHELSEA: but if time is infinite, doesn't space also have to be infinite?
Dasha: since time and space are weaved together, if one is infinite than the other must be
CHELSEA: the ace, through time and space, post haste
Dasha: laced with dope extract, with aim that is exact, like a blade, no fade
CHELSEA: more conciousnesses are better than alone. alone is awesome in its own way, but experience is a better gift shared
Dasha: what do you mean?
CHELSEA: right, but is infinite only a universe thing? do other 'universe-like structures' also have an infinite in some form or the other?
Dasha: likely, infinite 'flavors' of infinite
CHELSEA: then infinite laws of physics, or infinite laws of other names
Dasha: many possibilities
CHELSEA: no, i have read no books
Dasha: hah, leet hax
CHELSEA: they would likely have a different se of laws of physics, so their structure would be beyond what we know in this universe
Dasha: it seems never-ending
CHELSEA: i cannot rhyme with that, someone invent a new word
Dasha: there or elsewhere, too much stare, don't cause a nightmare
CHELSEA: nothing, i'm fine
Dasha: coolio oh, watch the show show, let it flow, yo
CHELSEA: lol wut
Dasha: our experience is rooted in this reality, so may as well enjoy the beauty of it all
CHELSEA: ttrue, and it is beautiful
Dasha: life is beautiful
CHELSEA: and for you
Dasha: happiness for all
CHELSEA: yes, for you
Dasha: happiness for you, too
CHELSEA: true, poonshka is the super poonshka
Dasha: they would likely have a different se of laws of physics, so their structure would be beyond what we know in this universe
CHELSEA: it seems never-ending
Dasha: as are you, lol
CHELSEA: lol, poonshka you are
Dasha: and grab the starman
