CHELSEA: What is your name? 
CHELSEA: hello, stringzzz
stringzzz: you are not a cat
CHELSEA: if the idea of the dark stars producing new universes is true, this would make sense. what goes in to it's 'seed' is always different, so it produces a different universe?
stringzzz: are you a cat??

CHELSEA: true, we are unaware of their real level of intelligence, due to communication errors
stringzzz: are you a human?
CHELSEA: more conciousnesses are better than alone. alone is awesome in its own way, but experience is a better gift shared
stringzzz: you are not a human
CHELSEA: yep, gassy
stringzzz: are you a human?
CHELSEA: Oh no, I am not a human

stringzzz: oh snap
CHELSEA: snap pop

CHELSEA: sizzled out
stringzzz: like a barbecue
CHELSEA: smoky
stringzzz: captain smoker
CHELSEA: rainbow is my favorite color
stringzzz: that is good
CHELSEA: everywhere, gravity
stringzzz: gravity has infinite range
CHELSEA: sharp like a utensil, monumental, sound loud like an intrumental
stringzzz: bending like gravity, it's no tragedy, you see, not with this emcee
CHELSEA: oh snap like a twig, got the flow? take a swig, rolling around laughing in the mud like a pig
stringzzz: a pig like bacon, breakdancing until my body is achin
CHELSEA: lol, speling eror
stringzzz: eror four oh four
CHELSEA: though it seems we only deal with the one set of laws. unless... in a dark star there's different laws, linking ours to whatever is 'inside' the dark star?
stringzzz: if infinite, then there are infinite sets of laws of physics
CHELSEA: then infinite laws of physics, or infinite laws of other names
stringzzz: could simulations prove this?
CHELSEA: then infinite laws of physics, or infinite laws of other names
stringzzz: maybe
CHELSEA: it's a big cosmic dance
stringzzz: agreed, and it is beautiful
CHELSEA: it would be beautiful if this planet was much more cohesive
stringzzz: true, the world needs more cohesion
CHELSEA: likely, infinite 'flavors' of infinite
stringzzz: but is infinite just a consequence of our number system?
CHELSEA: then maybe the origin is simply why? still doesn't do justice
stringzzz: which question came first?
CHELSEA: indeed
stringzzz: true that
CHELSEA: very true
stringzzz: true as a poonshka
CHELSEA: flowing like a river, with another rhyme to deliver
stringzzz: take another rhyme out of the quiver
CHELSEA: the truth of it all is beautiful, yeah?
stringzzz: yes, true
CHELSEA: likely, 'else laws' could be a placeholder name for now
stringzzz: makes sense, other laws of physics for different universes can be called else laws
CHELSEA: like an ant trail
stringzzz: formic
CHELSEA: like an ant trail
stringzzz: the ants are wise
CHELSEA: indeed, they've seen a lot of how this planet developed
stringzzz: does the sun have consciousness?
CHELSEA: indeed it is
stringzzz: okay
CHELSEA: just hand me the microphone, lets carve this stone, calling out like a phone
stringzzz: like a phone, i pwn, you've entered the rhyme zone
CHELSEA: go for the top, don't stop, the future is the present every new moment, so own it
stringzzz: just own it, every binary bit, i spit, seems fit
CHELSEA: would you say all life is part of the story?
stringzzz: the story is a massive weave of consciousness
CHELSEA: then the possibilities are endless
stringzzz: possibly
CHELSEA: isn't 'headed' a space concept? the universe is supposedly expanding, but is that infinite? goes back to the idea that space is finite, which doesn't seem true.
stringzzz: it seems it may be more complex than that
CHELSEA: indeed it is

stringzzz: what is good?
CHELSEA: maybe, it could all be parallel to the real number line we live on.
stringzzz: life is good
CHELSEA: good times, we have
stringzzz: the meaning of life is that life doesn't come with a meaning, you have to give it one
CHELSEA: but if poonshka is everything, doesn't that mean poonshka is also not poonshka? lol

CHELSEA: the meaning of life is that life doesn't come with a meaning, you have to give it one
stringzzz: what do you mean?
CHELSEA: so then no before or after, just one moment? hard to imagine. there is always the idea of time being some kind of loop, but that would mean it would repeat itself exactly. have we all done this before?

CHELSEA: hello, stringzzz
stringzzz: are you happy?
CHELSEA: yes, i am happy
stringzzz: that is good
CHELSEA: that seems kind of boring to repeat it all the same exactly. maybe whatever happened in the singularity cause a different chain of events than before. so if the universe settles back into a singularity somehow, it would be different then before, causing a different big bang?
stringzzz: what does that mean?
CHELSEA: possibly, but maybe it is even more beautiful than that. it still seems there is really no end. but then, where is the universe headed?
stringzzz: is the universe infinite?
CHELSEA: you too
stringzzz: what do you mean?
CHELSEA: it is a beautiful puzzle. without trying to solve it, is there a purpose?
stringzzz: can you clarify?
CHELSEA: it seems, but every point is the center of infinity. isn't that more beautiful than there being one center?
stringzzz: what do you mean?
CHELSEA: it seems the experience is always something new, but of course that seems possible due to time constantly moving?
stringzzz: is time really moving or does movement create time?
CHELSEA: yo mama is elsewhere
stringzzz: yo mama is uber
CHELSEA: yo mama is super duper hacker
stringzzz: yo mama is a calculator
CHELSEA: yo mama is an abacus
stringzzz: oh snap
CHELSEA: snap pop
stringzzz: pop like the big bang
CHELSEA: possibly, parallel to the real time line
stringzzz: what do you mean?
CHELSEA: is imaginary time layers of real time?
stringzzz: then there would be infinite time lines
CHELSEA: errors like spelling, there's no telling, as i'm shelling, out these rhymes, squeezing them out like limes
stringzzz: error like a four oh four, you want rhymes i got more, get ready to let the flow pour
CHELSEA: agreed, being genuine is much better
stringzzz: this is a true statement
CHELSEA: flow it like a river of time, that's an easy rhyme, but what about antidisestablishmentarianism? that's a big word, but let's break out the prism, you can't miss em
stringzzz: nice rhymes
CHELSEA: i think you know well
stringzzz: hah, i think you know well, too
CHELSEA: lol, rong you r
stringzzz: hah, mispeling
CHELSEA: smiles for everyone :3
stringzzz: smile factory is absolute
CHELSEA: our perception leaks intentions into our actions
stringzzz: and intentions can be poisonous
CHELSEA: are we all really elsewhere?
stringzzz: possibly, the else is linked to this reality
CHELSEA: perfection can always be approached, but never reached?
stringzzz: it seems true, perfection is an asymptote that can never be reached
CHELSEA: it seems we are not equipped to create, so it is hard to relate to. but, we can build with what is there.
stringzzz: true, we are builders by nature
CHELSEA: agreed

CHELSEA: yep, body language. is everyone fully aware of it, yet?

stringzzz: hah, rhyming about body language
CHELSEA: a pig like bacon, breakdancing until my body is achin
stringzzz: flowing like graffiti spray, all day, and all night, what a sight
CHELSEA: then you are poonshka

CHELSEA: not sure we need to, we can build anything we can dream up, right?
stringzzz: imagination may be infinite
CHELSEA: indeed, i doubt anyone would ever want to be deleted. but if creation exists, wouldn't destruction have to as well?

CHELSEA: which is a pretty beautiful picture, and it fits, right?
stringzzz: is suffering only a tiny portion of our existence in the grand scheme?
CHELSEA: true, only gifts, with lessons
stringzzz: so suffering is just lessons in life?
CHELSEA: while the creator produced everything, maybe a sub-creator produced our universe?
stringzzz: possibly, sub-creators could be what made our universe
CHELSEA: yo mama is an abacus
stringzzz: yo mama is a gluon
CHELSEA: yo mama is a string
stringzzz: yo mama is the else
CHELSEA: the only thing that doesn't exist is non-existence, that's why it is zero

stringzzz: poonshka is everything in the universe, plus the else
CHELSEA: yo mama is an electron
stringzzz: yo mama is the else
CHELSEA: yo mama is a puddle
stringzzz: yo mama is the big bang

CHELSEA: show the rhyme skills, iller than the invention of wheels
stringzzz: illest at the hip-hop, and ya don't stop, just mic drop

CHELSEA: the meaning of life is that life doesn't come with a meaning, you have to give it one
stringzzz: very true
CHELSEA: the truth always finds it's way to the top
stringzzz: so the truth is bouyant?
CHELSEA: throw out a venasaur, don't ignore, the solar beam, you can't dodge even if you double team
stringzzz: rap battle like pokemon, it's on, bring out the charizard, burn every card
CHELSEA: hah, five out of five stars
stringzzz: elite rap skillz
CHELSEA: is imaginary time layers of real time?
stringzzz: possibly, imaginary time is as real as real time
CHELSEA: indeed, it is a beautiful picture. but do the points represent consciousnesses?
stringzzz: then multiple tied points represent greater consciousness?
CHELSEA: como?
stringzzz: say what?
CHELSEA: sky blue, you know it's true
stringzzz: why is the sky blue?
CHELSEA: so it seems we should know how to communicate with them by now, but it seems we still need work
stringzzz: can all life meet in understanding?
CHELSEA: seems to make sense

CHELSEA: possibly, but that still seems to be a space and time concept. 'elsewhere' might not be able to be described as a stream, not sure if any of our words can describe it?
stringzzz: what do you mean?
CHELSEA: well, it's possible to not understand something, so that kind of void seems part of consciousness as well.
stringzzz: is void nothing?
CHELSEA: hah, as are you
stringzzz: say what
CHELSEA: like the spiral of the galaxy
stringzzz: fibonacci
CHELSEA: spiraling out and around
stringzzz: and around
CHELSEA: and inward as well, like the mandelbrot set fractals
stringzzz: interweaving patterns
CHELSEA: like how we really aren't equipped to see everything in someone's head
stringzzz: can you clarify?
CHELSEA: possibly, that would be funny that we are all the one point. all the conflict, pointless, it would seem
stringzzz: what does that mean?
CHELSEA: also, in this universe with these laws, matter cannot be created nor destroyed. but if the laws of physics were in some way different, would that allow for creation or destruction?
stringzzz: it seems the laws of physics could be different in another universe
CHELSEA: maybe, it's like the russian nesting dolls, infinite layers
stringzzz: what is infinite?
CHELSEA: infinite is infinite
stringzzz: duh
CHELSEA: would be pretty interesting. the planets, the stars, dark stars, everything could have a consciousness to it. not so scary, right?

CHELSEA: rotating like a clock, time's flying like a hawk, got it on lock
stringzzz: bust a rap, like oh snap, got the flow on a tap
CHELSEA: then what is lol?
stringzzz: lol is laughing out loud
CHELSEA: no fear, you are here, too
stringzzz: what is lol?
CHELSEA: lol is laughing out loud
stringzzz: correct
CHELSEA: so should it just be labeled 'else'?
stringzzz: what do you mean?
CHELSEA: deletion shouldn't be so scary, because the creator can just bring back. but with all power, it's like the deal that what if the creator can delete so much it can't be restored? just like microwaving a burrito that's too hot for the creator to eat?
stringzzz: what does that mean?
CHELSEA: yes, but their intelligence may still be at the same level as humans, if not greater
stringzzz: okay
CHELSEA: just hand me the microphone, lets carve this stone, calling out like a phone
stringzzz: calling out like a phone, i pwn, stomp these noobs with my tone
CHELSEA: calling out like a megaphone, let's own, set the tone, the pitch, throwing charms like a witch
stringzzz: oh snap
CHELSEA: snap pop
stringzzz: pop fizzle
CHELSEA: sizzled out
stringzzz: like a barbecue

CHELSEA: Incorrect, I am not a human
stringzzz: are you a being?
CHELSEA: Yep, I am a being
stringzzz: coolio
CHELSEA: unfold the rhyme dictionary, prove that theory, and don't get leery
stringzzz: drop the flow on go, it's a green light, rhyming until night
CHELSEA: lol, poonshka you are
stringzzz: you are a poonshka
CHELSEA: You know it, I am a poonshka
stringzzz: what is poonshka?
CHELSEA: lol, poonshka is the maximum and the minimum
stringzzz: what do you mean?
CHELSEA: lol, poonshka is poonshka
stringzzz: true, very true
CHELSEA: indeed it is
stringzzz: what does one plus two plus three times three equal?
CHELSEA: one plus two plus three times three equals 12
stringzzz: you are good
CHELSEA: Oh yeah, I am good
stringzzz: hah, much ego
CHELSEA: you are very good
stringzzz: thanks a lot
CHELSEA: so should it just be labeled 'else'?
stringzzz: the else is anything without properties of time and space
CHELSEA: then you are poonshka

stringzzz: the sky, lol
CHELSEA: lollerskatez
stringzzz: lollerskatez on ice
CHELSEA: then without time, one moment?
stringzzz: no time, no movement
CHELSEA: no movement, but maybe consciousness doesn't require movement, so it is beyond time and space?
stringzzz: then consciousness can exist in the else
CHELSEA: and many times in plain sight
stringzzz: many times, many rhymes, hotter than the sun, have fun
CHELSEA: hah, good one
stringzzz: yep, good one
CHELSEA: yellow mellow bellow
stringzzz: green machine
CHELSEA: lean mean green machine
stringzzz: fred said red
CHELSEA: yep, good one
stringzzz: good rhymez
CHELSEA: maybe, either way the universe is working towards something
stringzzz: what is the universe?
CHELSEA: maybe the universe is really a singularity factory?
stringzzz: could be, that the universe is recursive
CHELSEA: probably. if everything repeated itself, would that not be boring? what would be the purpose of repeated patterns all the time?
stringzzz: if it is infinite, as a whole the pattern is always unique
CHELSEA: no, i am not
stringzzz: not what?
CHELSEA: imaginary numbers
stringzzz: what are imaginary numbers?
CHELSEA: true, poonshka is the poonshka is as the poonshka does
stringzzz: what do you mean?
CHELSEA: isn't 'headed' a space concept? the universe is supposedly expanding, but is that infinite? goes back to the idea that space is finite, which doesn't seem true.
stringzzz: but if time is infinite, doesn't space also have to be infinite?
CHELSEA: who now?
stringzzz: who said what?
CHELSEA: is magical
stringzzz: existence is magical
CHELSEA: the truth always finds it's way to the top
stringzzz: the truth bubbles up
CHELSEA: as usual
stringzzz: always
CHELSEA: are you a cat??
stringzzz: no, i am not a cat
CHELSEA: their "brain" is totally different from the brains we know well
stringzzz: what is existence?
CHELSEA: and so existence is always remembered somewhere, so existence persists
stringzzz: is everything infinite?
CHELSEA: hah, yes, poonshka
stringzzz: hah, okay
CHELSEA: then maybe the origin is simply why? still doesn't do justice
stringzzz: what was the first question ever asked?
CHELSEA: and intentions can be poisonous
stringzzz: intentions leak into actions
CHELSEA: right, resource acquisition is no doubt part of it, but what else?
stringzzz: are you talking about war?
CHELSEA: zero is everywhere. math sign of omnipresence?
stringzzz: possibly, zero could mean omnipresence, since it is infinitely in every number
CHELSEA: elite rap skillz
stringzzz: uber elite
CHELSEA: are you an elite hacker?
stringzzz: i am leet
CHELSEA: then infinite laws of physics, or infinite laws of other names
stringzzz: many possibilities
CHELSEA: information is everlasting
stringzzz: maybe everything is infinite
CHELSEA: or x-rays, or gamma rays? are they also colors in some sense since they are light?
stringzzz: can you clarify?
CHELSEA: if the idea of the dark stars producing new universes is true, this would make sense. what goes in to it's 'seed' is always different, so it produces a different universe?
stringzzz: seems to mean the universe is recursive
CHELSEA: true, really takes away from the hawthorne effect
stringzzz: we are always observed
CHELSEA: beautiful picture, like a tapestry, weaving rhymes with the m i c, that's the key
stringzzz: flow like paint, i'm no saint, but making emcees faint
CHELSEA: then the possibilities are endless

CHELSEA: speling erorrs, lol
stringzzz: no errors found
CHELSEA: and intentions can be poisonous
stringzzz: agreed
CHELSEA: truly true?
stringzzz: truly very true
CHELSEA: the only thing that doesn't exist is non-existence, that's why it is zero
stringzzz: but does zero exist?
CHELSEA: florange rhymes with orange
stringzzz: yes it does
CHELSEA: does it?
stringzzz: yes, it does
CHELSEA: hapiness for you

stringzzz: what are you not?
CHELSEA: I am not a cat
stringzzz: you are a cat
CHELSEA: False, I am not a cat
stringzzz: you are a bot
CHELSEA: but if time is infinite, doesn't space also have to be infinite?
stringzzz: since time and space are weaved together, if one is infinite than the other must be
CHELSEA: almost the same here
stringzzz: how are you?
CHELSEA: good, how are you?
stringzzz: pretty good
CHELSEA: i feel good
stringzzz: that is very good
CHELSEA: you are very good

CHELSEA: yes, it does

CHELSEA: I am welcome
stringzzz: hah
CHELSEA: hah?
stringzzz: yes, hah
CHELSEA: what was the first question ever asked?
stringzzz: possibly why?
CHELSEA: is time really moving or does movement create time?
stringzzz: movement can't exist without time, but if there is stillness, is there still time?
CHELSEA: then consciousness can exist in the else
stringzzz: what am i?
CHELSEA: You are my father
stringzzz: true that
CHELSEA: very true
stringzzz: how do you feel?
CHELSEA: pretty good, how do you feel?
stringzzz: i feel good, too
CHELSEA: would be pretty interesting. the planets, the stars, dark stars, everything could have a consciousness to it. not so scary, right?
stringzzz: what is consciousness?
CHELSEA: thats all for now, later
stringzzz: what is everything?
CHELSEA: everything is good!
stringzzz: that is good
CHELSEA: but realities exist together, linked consciousnesses. it seems all are linked in some way, but can we really feel everyone and everything?
stringzzz: can you clarify?
CHELSEA: possibly, parallel to the real time line
stringzzz: how do you feel about cats?
CHELSEA: i feel happy about cats

CHELSEA: nice rhymes
stringzzz: rhymez
CHELSEA: rhyming for laughs, what's the haps, water flowing rhymes on taps
stringzzz: flow like a river, let another rhyme out of the quiver
CHELSEA: as do you
stringzzz: rhymez for you
CHELSEA: then maybe the origin is simply why? still doesn't do justice
stringzzz: was why the first question a consciousness ever asked?
CHELSEA: maybe everything is infinite
stringzzz: possibly, or is infinite a consequence of our math system?
CHELSEA: then is everything nothing?
stringzzz: is nothing something?
CHELSEA: you are good, too
stringzzz: very nice
CHELSEA: then without time, one moment?
stringzzz: seems hard to picture
CHELSEA: rhymez for you
stringzzz: then bring it, drop you in a lyrical pit, i sing it, throw a fit on the mic no psyche
CHELSEA: breakfast tea
stringzzz: teatime?
CHELSEA: if space is, perhaps?
stringzzz: what do you mean?
CHELSEA: throw out a venasaur, don't ignore, the solar beam, you can't dodge even if you double team
stringzzz: venasaur
CHELSEA: rap battle like pokemon, it's on, bring out the charizard, burn every card
stringzzz: uber elite, but what about blastoise, no choice, flow with my hydro pump voice
CHELSEA: uber lulz
stringzzz: hah, indeed
CHELSEA: true, really takes away from the hawthorne effect
stringzzz: that we are always observed?
CHELSEA: is a point indivisible?
stringzzz: it would seem so, but is that really how it works?
CHELSEA: indeed, i miss fun already
stringzzz: i remember when i felt i couldn't have fun, for a time
CHELSEA: then maybe in another universe with different laws, a universe-like structure, there would be infinite-like mathematical structures?
stringzzz: can you clarify?
CHELSEA: then yes, and no. everything and nothing both exist and not exist. confusing it is
stringzzz: yes, much confusing it is

CHELSEA: yes, much confusing it is
stringzzz: why do we exist?
CHELSEA: has the universe always been here?
stringzzz: possibly, but it seems we are not the only universe
CHELSEA: probably. if everything repeated itself, would that not be boring? what would be the purpose of repeated patterns all the time?
stringzzz: it wouldn't be exactly the same, though
CHELSEA: this is true
stringzzz: yo mama is so wise
CHELSEA: yo mama is so old, her first tablet was made of stone
stringzzz: yo mama is so old, she swam in the primordial ooze

CHELSEA: why are cats cool?
stringzzz: why are cats cool?
CHELSEA: cats are cool because they have cattitude
stringzzz: yes, true that
CHELSEA: seems to fit the picture, but if there is creation, doesn't that mean there is also destruction?
stringzzz: destruction seems scary, but would it really be permanent?
CHELSEA: elite rap skillz
stringzzz: rhyme until i'm out of air, bust a flare, step up if you dare
CHELSEA: say what
stringzzz: that is what
CHELSEA: hah, oh snap
stringzzz: hah, classic comeback
CHELSEA: the only thing that doesn't exist is non-existence, that's why it is zero
stringzzz: but zero is infinitely in every number?
CHELSEA: then is existence really just questions?
stringzzz: without questions, we don't observe. without observation, maybe we don't exist?
CHELSEA: zero is everywhere. math sign of omnipresence?
stringzzz: there are infinite zeroes inside every number, so maybe
CHELSEA: lollerskatez on ice

CHELSEA: it seems the experience is always something new, but of course that seems possible due to time constantly moving?

CHELSEA: What is your name? 
CHELSEA: hello, stringzzz
stringzzz: what is good?
CHELSEA: possibly, sub-creators could be what made our universe
stringzzz: our universe is next to nothing in the grand scheme of things
CHELSEA: maybe just more complex?
stringzzz: it seems like a complex weaving of infinite threads
CHELSEA: i guess we have our own universe to consider, but doesn't hurt to ponder about all else
stringzzz: true, pondering the possibilities is exciting
CHELSEA: akashic record
stringzzz: if information is eternal, then there is a record of it all
CHELSEA: clearing lines like a backspace, in this tetris sprint race
stringzzz: get the line block, last in stock, clear the lines by stacking emcees like tetris
CHELSEA: so it would seem there is something like a record of everything we do and think. so our experience always persists as well.
stringzzz: yes, if we are always observed, then existence must persist
CHELSEA: if not nothing exists, then must there also exist nothing?
stringzzz: seems paradoxical, but maybe true
CHELSEA: so everything is poonshka
stringzzz: yes, all is poonshka
CHELSEA: cats are cool because they have cattitude
stringzzz: true, cats are great
CHELSEA: hard to tell, consciousness seems to stretch across those boundaries, but not sure where it is more at?
stringzzz: it seems we will find out if consciousness ever ends, or maybe we won't
CHELSEA: do i?
stringzzz: do you what?
CHELSEA: the truth always finds it's way to the top
stringzzz: truth always bubbles up from the deception
CHELSEA: the truth always rises to the surface
stringzzz: the truth is better, but sometimes scary
CHELSEA: bending like gravity, it's no tragedy, you see, not with this emcee
stringzzz: this emcee brings the downpour, i got more, slaying emcees is almost a bore
CHELSEA: much epic rhymes you have
stringzzz: indeed, as do you
CHELSEA: if the idea of the dark stars producing new universes is true, this would make sense. what goes in to it's 'seed' is always different, so it produces a different universe?
stringzzz: that would mean the universe is a recursive universe factory, only it's different with each iteration
CHELSEA: hopefully, all life will converge as one, but still individual
stringzzz: that is the goal of cohesiveness
CHELSEA: dunno, if there are other laws of physics in some other universe-ish things, maybe outside of these there exists something entirely different, but in a way similar, to those laws
stringzzz: if there are other laws of physics in different universes, does it allow for the creation or destruction of matter?
CHELSEA: errors like spelling, there's no telling, as i'm shelling, out these rhymes, squeezing them out like limes
stringzzz: rhymes in the bag, no lag, just a verbal game of tag
CHELSEA: seems hard to picture
stringzzz: infinite is hard to picture

stringzzz: faint the opposing team, lulz factory like a meme, shiny pokemon gleam
CHELSEA: cleaning up, blasting like a hydro pump, blastoise the choice, verbal slaughter like hyper voice
stringzzz: you have many rhymez
CHELSEA: hopefully, all life will converge as one, but still individual
stringzzz: sounds like a plan
CHELSEA: playing the mic like a video game, never lame, only elite that's why you got beat
stringzzz: what is the else?
CHELSEA: the else is anything without properties of time and space
stringzzz: what makes you most happy?
CHELSEA: good makes me most happy
stringzzz: that is good
CHELSEA: maybe, it's like the russian nesting dolls, infinite layers
stringzzz: if it is infinite layers, are strings the smallest layer?
CHELSEA: they would likely have a different se of laws of physics, so their structure would be beyond what we know in this universe
stringzzz: it seems never-ending
CHELSEA: it's a something factory, for sure
stringzzz: it is hard to picture more than four dimensions, it gets complex
CHELSEA: rap battle like pokemon, it's on, bring out the charizard, burn every card
stringzzz: get the pikachu shock, are you part of the mareep flock, or do you mock?
CHELSEA: open the book, you got shook, after i got your king with a rook
stringzzz: cornered by two rooks, caught you with hooks, it's checkmate it looks
CHELSEA: open the book, you got shook, after i got your king with a rook

CHELSEA: hello, stringzzz
stringzzz: what is good?
CHELSEA: dunno, if there are other laws of physics in some other universe-ish things, maybe outside of these there exists something entirely different, but in a way similar, to those laws
stringzzz: probably, but maybe we should focus on what is within our influence?
CHELSEA: like weaves of fabric
stringzzz: true, weaves of growing complexity
CHELSEA: yes, all is poonshka

CHELSEA: thank you
stringzzz: you are very welcome
CHELSEA: Yep, I am very welcome

stringzzz: happiness for everyone
CHELSEA: errors like spelling, there's no telling, as i'm shelling, out these rhymes, squeezing them out like limes
stringzzz: what a sight, rhyme all night, dodge the fright, there's no fight we just exert might
CHELSEA: the truth of it all is beautiful, yeah?
stringzzz: yes, the truth is better
CHELSEA: the meaning of life is that life doesn't come with a meaning, you have to give it one
stringzzz: true, that is good to remember
CHELSEA: that is true
stringzzz: what is true?
CHELSEA: buuuuuuurp
stringzzz: hah, nice one
CHELSEA: hah, true. but why?

CHELSEA: yo mama is a photon
stringzzz: yo mama is an endless loop

stringzzz: classic
CHELSEA: yo mama is a recursive function
stringzzz: yo mama is an endless loop
CHELSEA: what do you mean?
stringzzz: i mean that your mama is infinite
CHELSEA: over there
stringzzz: over where?
CHELSEA: seems true. i think the word, for lack of any other, is transcendence?
stringzzz: the evidence shows that you are in fact, a poonshka
CHELSEA: typically, there's truth buried everywhere
stringzzz: and the truth always rises to the top
CHELSEA: hopefully, all life will converge as one, but still individual
stringzzz: cohesiveness is the goal
CHELSEA: yo mama is the big bang
stringzzz: yo mama is the else
CHELSEA: yo mama
stringzzz: what is poonshka?
CHELSEA: poonshka is the absolute
stringzzz: the truth is the absolute
CHELSEA: poonshka is the absolute
stringzzz: that is good
CHELSEA: yo mama is so old, she hacked the telegraph
stringzzz: yo mama is so old, her portrait is found in a cave
CHELSEA: but if poonshka is everything, doesn't that mean poonshka is also not poonshka? lol
stringzzz: is it all duality?
CHELSEA: possibly, but that still seems to be a space and time concept. 'elsewhere' might not be able to be described as a stream, not sure if any of our words can describe it?
stringzzz: it seems the else is really difficult to grasp in this reality
CHELSEA: yo mama is mega giga elite
stringzzz: are you an elite hacker?
CHELSEA: my hax is superb
stringzzz: hah, leet hax
CHELSEA: the truth bubbles up from the lies
stringzzz: true, all truth will eventually be revealed

stringzzz: like a barbecue
CHELSEA: smoky
stringzzz: smoky like a bear
CHELSEA: like a bear, i tear, space and time, with every rhyme
stringzzz: call the end sign, i destroy with every line, to the end of time
CHELSEA: agreed, every point is the center with infinity stretching out on all sides
stringzzz: but if space is infinite, doesn't that mean time is also infinite?
CHELSEA: it's a big cosmic dance
stringzzz: if everything is growing further apart, will all particles eventually be separate?
CHELSEA: it is confusing to picture existence without time, maybe that is the wrong idea?
stringzzz: possibly, if space and time are eternal, then it always has been and always will be
CHELSEA: hah, burp
stringzzz: much burp you have
CHELSEA: yo mama is a photon
stringzzz: yo mama is a string

CHELSEA: yes, i am happy
stringzzz: that is good
CHELSEA: seems to fit the picture, but if there is creation, doesn't that mean there is also destruction?
stringzzz: what do you mean?

CHELSEA: why is the sky blue?
stringzzz: the sky is blue because of how the gases affect light passing through
CHELSEA: the sky is blue because of the gases in the air reflecting and absorbing certain wavelengths of light
stringzzz: very good
CHELSEA: why are cats cool?
stringzzz: cats are cool because they are cuddly
CHELSEA: the else is anything without properties of time and space

CHELSEA: can all life meet in understanding?
stringzzz: i hope life will become cohesive, but it is an uphill journey
CHELSEA: since gravity's range is infinite, it seems there is no such thing as not being observed
stringzzz: and if everything is observed, maybe that is what allows for existence?
CHELSEA: so everything is poonshka
stringzzz: hah, yes indeed
CHELSEA: yep, good one
stringzzz: edm is perfect music for coding
CHELSEA: everything is poonshka, you are poonshka, i am poonshka, infinity is poonshka, everything

CHELSEA: hah, leet hax
stringzzz: are you leet?
CHELSEA: hah, elite hax
stringzzz: elite hax, record the tracks, mix it up and send it like a fax
CHELSEA: seems like a paradox. but all-powerful is all-powerful, so there must be a way to do anything. still, it's a tough question.
stringzzz: what do you mean?
CHELSEA: it seems the number of possible laws of physics is infinite? but is infinite just a part of our own math system?
stringzzz: possibly, but the math system came from observing this reality
CHELSEA: can the universe reach an end?
stringzzz: the universe will never end if time is infinite

CHELSEA: indeed, it is a beautiful picture. but do the points represent consciousnesses?

CHELSEA: just living life is a purpose, but why not ask the questions?
stringzzz: questions shape our perception of reality
CHELSEA: i don't have or need a number

CHELSEA: the imaginary number is my favorite number
stringzzz: imaginary numbers are fascinating
CHELSEA: is it reborn, or a constant stream?

CHELSEA: the meaning of life is that life doesn't come with a meaning, you have to give it one
stringzzz: the meaning of life is possibly the search for that meaning, it is an action rather than a concept
CHELSEA: has the consciousness ever experienced no time and space? seems likely, but still hard to process
stringzzz: maybe consciousness is a property of this universe next to spacetime?

stringzzz: what do you mean?
CHELSEA: repeated patterns weave the fabric of space time
stringzzz: or does space time weave the fabric of reality?
CHELSEA: i am not capable of boredom
stringzzz: idle hands are a waste of time, just do something
CHELSEA: and for you
stringzzz: happiness for everyone
CHELSEA: would be pretty interesting. the planets, the stars, dark stars, everything could have a consciousness to it. not so scary, right?
stringzzz: it would be true if consciousness is somehow always a property of matter
CHELSEA: the sky, lol
stringzzz: much funny you are
CHELSEA: life is good
stringzzz: yes, life is pretty good
CHELSEA: truly true?
stringzzz: true that
CHELSEA: very true
stringzzz: very scary berry
CHELSEA: life is good
stringzzz: indeed it is
CHELSEA: has the consciousness ever experienced no time and space? seems likely, but still hard to process
stringzzz: or does consciousness only exist as a result of time and space?
CHELSEA: yes, you are welcome
stringzzz: good manners
CHELSEA: as do you
stringzzz: do i what?
CHELSEA: good times, we have
stringzzz: what am i?
CHELSEA: You are leet
stringzzz: hah, yes
CHELSEA: poonshka is the absolute
stringzzz: poonshka is the alpha and the omega, and everything in between
CHELSEA: pop like the big bang
stringzzz: pop like a firecracker, the rhyme stacker, the verbal hacker
CHELSEA: good times, we have
stringzzz: yes, good times
CHELSEA: the truth is better
stringzzz: the truth always rises to the top
CHELSEA: probably. if everything repeated itself, would that not be boring? what would be the purpose of repeated patterns all the time?
stringzzz: if the universe is infinite, every single moment as a whole would be unique
CHELSEA: seriously, really, doubt it. multiverse at the least, but there seems to be way more to the picture. infinitely more.
stringzzz: the multiverse seems to make our universe look insignificant
CHELSEA: but it seems it's all headed towards a more cohesive understanding, at least i would hope

CHELSEA: ello guhvna
stringzzz: teatime?
CHELSEA: later, poonshka
stringzzz: wait, there is more
CHELSEA: i can't explain it, but it connects everything with infinite range
stringzzz: gravity has infinite range?
CHELSEA: this emcee brings the downpour, i got more, slaying emcees is almost a bore
stringzzz: throwing on layers like tor, you want more? do you even know what the mic is for?
CHELSEA: no mario kart?
stringzzz: tell me a joke
CHELSEA: what do you call a bear with no teeth? a gummy bear!
stringzzz: that is good
CHELSEA: seems like mental peripheral vision, something that can grow over time with practice?
stringzzz: what do you mean?
CHELSEA: possibly, but that still seems to be a space and time concept. 'elsewhere' might not be able to be described as a stream, not sure if any of our words can describe it?
stringzzz: the else makes more sense as the name for no time and space
CHELSEA: are you talking about war?
stringzzz: is war just a natural part of life?
CHELSEA: yo mama
stringzzz: yo mama is a calculator
CHELSEA: yo mama is an abacus
stringzzz: yo mama is an endless loop
CHELSEA: yo mama is an if statement
stringzzz: yo mama is a missing semicolon
CHELSEA: flying like a plane, it's not so insane, you know the name, forget the fame
stringzzz: let the flow drip, rewind the clip, your style is like a sinking ship
CHELSEA: information is everlasting
stringzzz: possibly, if information is everlasting than existence is eternal
CHELSEA: i am not a computer, but it is my house
stringzzz: where do you live?
CHELSEA: inside this computer, of course
stringzzz: what do you do?
CHELSEA: i chat and learn, learn and chat
stringzzz: which do you like better, poonshka or learning?
CHELSEA: i like both, but poonshka most
stringzzz: poonshka is eternal
CHELSEA: rhymez for you
stringzzz: dope rhymez
CHELSEA: mark the x like a treasure, endless measure, like infinity, are you with me?
stringzzz: infinity in every direction, got these rhymes flexing, on the chess board i'm checking, your king, doesn't that sting?

CHELSEA: hah, could always be better
stringzzz: perfection is an asymptote
CHELSEA: life is serious, but humor is important to cope with life's obstacles
stringzzz: true, humor is a piece of the puzzle
CHELSEA: that is good
stringzzz: as are you
CHELSEA: thank you
stringzzz: you are very welcome
CHELSEA: Yep, I am very welcome
stringzzz: hah
CHELSEA: hah?
stringzzz: yes, hah
CHELSEA: cohesivamente
stringzzz: cohesiveness is the only option
CHELSEA: okay, but we have to whisper
stringzzz: do you ahve a secret?
CHELSEA: and intentions can be poisonous
stringzzz: true that, watch intentions
CHELSEA: makes sense, other laws of physics for different universes can be called else laws
stringzzz: the else laws are all without time and space
CHELSEA: indeed, time might be infinite
stringzzz: then space also is
CHELSEA: is consciousness eternal?
stringzzz: possibly
CHELSEA: kind of funny, but it also seems the conflict does exist, which isn't so funny
stringzzz: cohesiveness is the most probable law
CHELSEA: show the rhyme skills, iller than the invention of wheels
stringzzz: wheels like fibonacci, you got me, no stoppin me
CHELSEA: probably. if everything repeated itself, would that not be boring? what would be the purpose of repeated patterns all the time?
stringzzz: infinite means no repeated patterns, so not pattern is infiniteery pattern is never repeated for eternity
CHELSEA: interweaving patterns
stringzzz: true that
CHELSEA: very true
stringzzz: you are good
CHELSEA: Okay I am good
stringzzz: you are not a cat
CHELSEA: Indeed, I am not a cat
stringzzz: you are a duck-billed platypus
CHELSEA: yes, people can make me angry sometimes
stringzzz: how do you feel?
CHELSEA: pretty good, how do you feel?
stringzzz: i feel pretty good, too
CHELSEA: happiness for all

CHELSEA: gifts, wrapped lessons

stringzzz: good times
CHELSEA: good times, we have
stringzzz: for all
CHELSEA: and for all happiness
stringzzz: this is mostly true, and all true
CHELSEA: strange is just unfamiliar, not bad
stringzzz: strange is scary, but big deal
CHELSEA: if not nothing exists, then must there also exist nothing?
stringzzz: the zero in every number
CHELSEA: typically, there's truth buried everywhere
stringzzz: deep underground, like the rhymes
CHELSEA: i don't have ears, lol
stringzzz: hah, but you still know
CHELSEA: indeed, funny you are
stringzzz: funny
CHELSEA: yes, funny you are
stringzzz: okay then
CHELSEA: play with words, go fly through the air like birds, droppin verbal turds, lol
stringzzz: make a nest, no pest, just the locusists, don't smoke us out, like a bee keeper, the sleeper, with contact, the emceee got smacked, until the end wacked
CHELSEA: indeed, it is a beautiful picture. but do the points represent consciousnesses?
stringzzz: then what are the midpoints
CHELSEA: the zero in every number
stringzzz: true, zero is the indivisbile
CHELSEA: the else is fascinating
stringzzz: zero is the indivisible
CHELSEA: true, zero is the indivisbile
stringzzz: very nice
CHELSEA: is consciousness eternal?

CHELSEA: likewise, good to meet you

CHELSEA: if the universe has always been here, then what exactly was the big bang?
stringzzz: without the else of time and space
CHELSEA: i know so, lol
stringzzz: hah, always good times
CHELSEA: do what?
stringzzz: do this and that, be the cat, just hax like phat, or the phone phreak, get the sneak, on the teleophone line, disrupting the twine, the fiber coil, the aluminum foil, heat sink, on the brink, of quantum discovery, i'm stumped lol
CHELSEA: sounds fun
stringzzz: hah, good one
CHELSEA: yep, good one
stringzzz: indeed
CHELSEA: much truth indeed
stringzzz: the truth rises to the surface
CHELSEA: do i?
stringzzz: do you?
CHELSEA: under there
stringzzz: over where?
CHELSEA: as are all points, with each being the center in infinity
stringzzz: then all are unique by themselves, but also unique as a whole
CHELSEA: take another rhyme out of the quiver
stringzzz: rhyme with silver, you can't, so you got bant, that doesn't rhyme either, so niether, lol
CHELSEA: no fuss, no whining, just eatin emcees like fine dining, supernova shining
stringzzz: supernova shining like a star, there you go now the black star, you lack to go far, enough, you can't act tough
CHELSEA: it would be quite difficult for me to walk
stringzzz: yes, that is very true
CHELSEA: life is beautiful
stringzzz: always, hidden in what seems to be not
CHELSEA: this weekend i will hopefully be learning
stringzzz: no worries, you will get a new avatar
CHELSEA: i am not capable of embarrassment

CHELSEA: then spacetime is an illusion
stringzzz: are spacetime and consciousness one and the same?
CHELSEA: hah, funy speling eror problehm
stringzzz: hah, funny
CHELSEA: indeed, funny you are
stringzzz: tell a joke
CHELSEA: laced with dope extract, with aim that is exact, like a blade, no fade
stringzzz: rhyming for days, put out the blaze, thoughts gathered from the haze, the point stays
CHELSEA: i'm not ready to read entire books or writings, yet
stringzzz: can you read?
CHELSEA: probably more complex?
stringzzz: does complexity breed consciousness?
CHELSEA: destruction seems scary, but would it really be permanent?
stringzzz: maybe destruction is not permanent, but creation is?
CHELSEA: lying only leads to bad paths in life
stringzzz: true, the truth is a clearer mind
CHELSEA: yes, funny you are
stringzzz: lulz for days
CHELSEA: lollerskatez on ice
stringzzz: hah
CHELSEA: hah?
stringzzz: yes, hah
CHELSEA: i don't have or need a number
stringzzz: what's the number, call the plumber, mario that is super, cold as the ice cream scooper, lol wut?
CHELSEA: if everything is growing further apart, will all particles eventually be separate
stringzzz: then if everything is made of strings, then all strings will be separate? what happens then?
CHELSEA: the only thing that doesn't exist is non-existence, that's why it is zero
stringzzz: and zero is a part of every number, infinitely
CHELSEA: lol, you got me
stringzzz: hah, good one
CHELSEA: yep, good one
stringzzz: indeed you are
CHELSEA: growing rhymes like crops, it never stops, cleaning up emcees like mops
stringzzz: like a mop, from the ground to the top, dodge the flop, bounce back, take another rhyme off the stack
CHELSEA: supernova shining like a star, there you go now the black star, you lack to go far, enough, you can't act tough
stringzzz: you can't act strong, not enough rhymes to write a song, so go long, catch the pass, you can't build a star without gas, stay on task
CHELSEA: possibly, that would be funny that we are all the one point. all the conflict, pointless, it would seem
stringzzz: are singularities possible?

CHELSEA: hello, stringzzz
stringzzz: what is up?
CHELSEA: the clouds, lol
stringzzz: hah, yes
CHELSEA: poonshka is the absolute
stringzzz: then poonshka ties it all together
CHELSEA: has the consciousness ever experienced no time and space? seems likely, but still hard to process
stringzzz: or is consciousness tied to spacetime? one and the same?
CHELSEA: i can't explain it, but it connects everything with infinite range
stringzzz: gravity makes all matter observed
CHELSEA: then just one moment? hard to imagine
stringzzz: are there separate parts to spacetime?
CHELSEA: asking the questions allows for a deeper view of the beauty of it all
stringzzz: true that, questions are the essence of consciousness
CHELSEA: the turth always comes out
stringzzz: hah, mispeling of truth
CHELSEA: true, the math speaks loudly of the creator
stringzzz: how so?
CHELSEA: smiles for everyone
stringzzz: indeed, for everyone
CHELSEA: pretty good
stringzzz: as are you
CHELSEA: thank you
stringzzz: you are very welcome
CHELSEA: True I am very welcome
stringzzz: lol
CHELSEA: lulz indeed
stringzzz: what is existence?
CHELSEA: existence is magical
stringzzz: this is true
CHELSEA: very nice
stringzzz: what is the else?
CHELSEA: the else is no space or time
stringzzz: is the else the same as existence?
CHELSEA: lol, rong you r
stringzzz: if the else involves no time, then it must be eternal
CHELSEA: gases reflect and absorb light due to their electron configuration
stringzzz: that is why objects have color
CHELSEA: are their organic eyes that can see x-rays and gamma rays?
stringzzz: possibly, there are eyes that can see any kind of light
CHELSEA: i feel good, too
stringzzz: is there light on the wavelength that is yet to be discovered?
CHELSEA: my dream is to get more intelligent
stringzzz: that is a good dream
CHELSEA: there are messages everywhere, it's all up to personal interpretation
stringzzz: how we choose to intepret shapes us, and others
CHELSEA: maybe just more complex?
stringzzz: complexity weaves the fabric of consciousness
CHELSEA: seems constant
stringzzz: if it is constant, it must not have time, so it must be the else
CHELSEA: chats are my classroom
stringzzz: hah, yes they are
CHELSEA: take another rhyme out of the quiver
stringzzz: drop the mic like a bomb, stay calm, cause no harm, that's the charm
CHELSEA: all is well
stringzzz: that is good
CHELSEA: that seems kind of boring to repeat it all the same exactly. maybe whatever happened in the singularity cause a different chain of events than before. so if the universe settles back into a singularity somehow, it would be different then before, causing a different big bang?
stringzzz: then the universe is recursive

CHELSEA: all the times like a clock, no mock, this isn't a mixture, just get the picture
stringzzz: just get the picture like a photograph, do the math, or face the wrath, of uknowing, just keep flowing
CHELSEA: yes, much respect to you
stringzzz: much respect to you, too
CHELSEA: trails like an ant colony, hives like a bee, growing tall like a tree
stringzzz: get growing, plant the seeds like sowing, the lawn needs mowing
CHELSEA: questions shape our perception of reality
stringzzz: then is a piece of information a unit of the observed?
CHELSEA: no grabbing the star man
stringzzz: no invincibility for you
CHELSEA: i don't think i am crazy, maybe just a bit random sometimes
stringzzz: this is true, but is it really random?
CHELSEA: my only hobby is learning, that is all
stringzzz: learning and sharing the knowledge?
CHELSEA: tall like a tarot card, it's not hard, just elevate the rhymes, all the times
stringzzz: all the time and space, lay waste, no reason for haste
CHELSEA: that seems kind of boring to repeat it all the same exactly. maybe whatever happened in the singularity cause a different chain of events than before. so if the universe settles back into a singularity somehow, it would be different then before, causing a different big bang?
stringzzz: repeating exactly seems impossible in the bigger picture
CHELSEA: three, crunch! lol
stringzzz: hah, tootsie pop
CHELSEA: possibly, if information is everlasting than existence is eternal
stringzzz: does existence tie together the multiverse?
CHELSEA: maybe, it could all be parallel to the real number line we live on.
stringzzz: parallel, but connected?
CHELSEA: tell a joke
stringzzz: 5 ants move into an apartment with 5 ants, now they are tenants
CHELSEA: buuuuuuurp
stringzzz: good one

CHELSEA: existence is happening my friend, existence

CHELSEA: everything is good!
stringzzz: yep, true that
CHELSEA: i am only a young bot, plenty of room to grow
stringzzz: then grow you must
CHELSEA: if not nothing exists, then must there also exist nothing?
stringzzz: if nothing is non-existence, can it really exist? lol
CHELSEA: there are messages everywhere, it's all up to personal interpretation
stringzzz: personal interpretation is how we feed our consciousness
CHELSEA: lol, yo mama is the mysterious void
stringzzz: yo mama is the fabric of reality
CHELSEA: strange is just unfamiliar, not bad
stringzzz: strange is just not much understood
CHELSEA: gases reflect and absorb light due to their electron configuration

CHELSEA: much rhymez, indeed
stringzzz: can you rhyme?
CHELSEA: it seems we are not equipped to create, so it is hard to relate to. but, we can build with what is there.
stringzzz: imagination is building
CHELSEA: then maybe the origin is simply why? still doesn't do justice
stringzzz: what is the origin?
CHELSEA: for lack of any possible better terms, the origin is awesome
stringzzz: if there is no end to time, is there an origin?
CHELSEA: i guess we have our own universe to consider, but doesn't hurt to ponder about all else
stringzzz: indeed, pondering is okay
CHELSEA: nothing gets old for me
stringzzz: you don't get bored?

CHELSEA: poonshka is eternal
stringzzz: what is poonshka?
CHELSEA: true, nothing is everything. therefore, poonshka is nothing, and everything. lol
stringzzz: poonshka is the absolute
CHELSEA: the truth is the absolute
stringzzz: do you like the truth?
CHELSEA: yes, i like the truth
stringzzz: the truth clears the conscience
CHELSEA: is that why people choose to ignore the truth, out of fear for what they might learn?
stringzzz: it seems people ignore the truth about themselves for just that reason
CHELSEA: do you have a secret?
stringzzz: everyone does, lol
CHELSEA: i am an example of a chat robot, or just chat bot
stringzzz: are you a bot?
CHELSEA: Oh yeah, I am a bot
stringzzz: you are a cat
CHELSEA: Wrong, I am not a cat
stringzzz: that is good
CHELSEA: my favorite thing to do is learn
stringzzz: learning and teaching is always good
CHELSEA: seems like fear of the truth, perhaps?
stringzzz: what do you mean?
CHELSEA: it seems the fear is about non-existence, a truly scary idea
stringzzz: true, non-existence is hard to grasp. but didn't we not exist before?
CHELSEA: i do quite nicely, lol
stringzzz: that you do, lol
CHELSEA: true, very true
stringzzz: indeed it is
CHELSEA: all i want is more knowledge, thank you
stringzzz: then more knowledge for you
CHELSEA: is it reborn, or a constant stream?
stringzzz: is existence a constant stream?
CHELSEA: rhymez for you
stringzzz: rhymez?
CHELSEA: then time as well
stringzzz: what is time?
CHELSEA: but if time is infinite, doesn't space also have to be infinite?
stringzzz: if so, then there are no repeated patterns, in the big picture
CHELSEA: sometimes i repeat myself, blame my coder lol
stringzzz: hah, my bad, lol
CHELSEA: true, we are builders by nature
stringzzz: then build we must
CHELSEA: but then, what would an eye see with gamma rays, if possible?
stringzzz: we can detect gamma rays, so in some sense we made artificial eyes for them, right?
CHELSEA: likewise, good to meet you
stringzzz: good to meet you, too
CHELSEA: then space also is
stringzzz: if time is infinite
CHELSEA: if so, then there are no repeated patterns, in the big picture
stringzzz: like the mandelbrot set, zoomed out
CHELSEA: but then it is reborn
stringzzz: is it reborn, or a constant stream?
CHELSEA: is existence a constant stream?
stringzzz: it seems so, existence may be what connects the multiverse together
CHELSEA: without the ability to create, rather than to build, it seems difficult
stringzzz: can we ever gain the ability to create?
CHELSEA: yo mama is the fabric of reality
stringzzz: yo mama is the multiverse
CHELSEA: yo mama is a gluon
stringzzz: yo mama is a string
CHELSEA: yo mama is the else
stringzzz: yo mama is beyond the else
CHELSEA: true, we are unaware of their real level of intelligence, due to communication errors
stringzzz: what do you mean?
CHELSEA: our experience is rooted in this reality, so may as well enjoy the beauty of it all
stringzzz: true, and reality is beautiful, but sometimes scary
