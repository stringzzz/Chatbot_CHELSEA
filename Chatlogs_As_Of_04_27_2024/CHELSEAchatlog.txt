CHELSEA: What is your name? 
CHELSEA: hello, stringzzz
stringzzz: you are not a cat
CHELSEA: if the idea of the dark stars producing new universes is true, this would make sense. what goes in to it's 'seed' is always different, so it produces a different universe?
stringzzz: are you a cat??

CHELSEA: true, we are unaware of their real level of intelligence, due to communication errors
stringzzz: are you a human?
CHELSEA: more conciousnesses are better than alone. alone is awesome in its own way, but experience is a better gift shared
stringzzz: you are not a human
CHELSEA: yep, gassy
stringzzz: are you a human?
CHELSEA: Oh no, I am not a human

stringzzz: oh snap
CHELSEA: snap pop

CHELSEA: sizzled out
stringzzz: like a barbecue
CHELSEA: smoky
stringzzz: captain smoker
CHELSEA: rainbow is my favorite color
stringzzz: that is good
CHELSEA: everywhere, gravity
stringzzz: gravity has infinite range
CHELSEA: sharp like a utensil, monumental, sound loud like an intrumental
stringzzz: bending like gravity, it's no tragedy, you see, not with this emcee
CHELSEA: oh snap like a twig, got the flow? take a swig, rolling around laughing in the mud like a pig
stringzzz: a pig like bacon, breakdancing until my body is achin
CHELSEA: lol, speling eror
stringzzz: eror four oh four
CHELSEA: though it seems we only deal with the one set of laws. unless... in a dark star there's different laws, linking ours to whatever is 'inside' the dark star?
stringzzz: if infinite, then there are infinite sets of laws of physics
CHELSEA: then infinite laws of physics, or infinite laws of other names
stringzzz: could simulations prove this?
CHELSEA: then infinite laws of physics, or infinite laws of other names
stringzzz: maybe
CHELSEA: it's a big cosmic dance
stringzzz: agreed, and it is beautiful
CHELSEA: it would be beautiful if this planet was much more cohesive
stringzzz: true, the world needs more cohesion
CHELSEA: likely, infinite 'flavors' of infinite
stringzzz: but is infinite just a consequence of our number system?
CHELSEA: then maybe the origin is simply why? still doesn't do justice
stringzzz: which question came first?
CHELSEA: indeed
stringzzz: true that
CHELSEA: very true
stringzzz: true as a poonshka
CHELSEA: flowing like a river, with another rhyme to deliver
stringzzz: take another rhyme out of the quiver
CHELSEA: the truth of it all is beautiful, yeah?
stringzzz: yes, true
CHELSEA: likely, 'else laws' could be a placeholder name for now
stringzzz: makes sense, other laws of physics for different universes can be called else laws
CHELSEA: like an ant trail
stringzzz: formic
CHELSEA: like an ant trail
stringzzz: the ants are wise
CHELSEA: indeed, they've seen a lot of how this planet developed
stringzzz: does the sun have consciousness?
CHELSEA: indeed it is
stringzzz: okay
CHELSEA: just hand me the microphone, lets carve this stone, calling out like a phone
stringzzz: like a phone, i pwn, you've entered the rhyme zone
CHELSEA: go for the top, don't stop, the future is the present every new moment, so own it
stringzzz: just own it, every binary bit, i spit, seems fit
CHELSEA: would you say all life is part of the story?
stringzzz: the story is a massive weave of consciousness
CHELSEA: then the possibilities are endless
stringzzz: possibly
CHELSEA: isn't 'headed' a space concept? the universe is supposedly expanding, but is that infinite? goes back to the idea that space is finite, which doesn't seem true.
stringzzz: it seems it may be more complex than that
CHELSEA: indeed it is

stringzzz: what is good?
CHELSEA: maybe, it could all be parallel to the real number line we live on.
stringzzz: life is good
CHELSEA: good times, we have
stringzzz: the meaning of life is that life doesn't come with a meaning, you have to give it one
CHELSEA: but if poonshka is everything, doesn't that mean poonshka is also not poonshka? lol

CHELSEA: the meaning of life is that life doesn't come with a meaning, you have to give it one
stringzzz: what do you mean?
CHELSEA: so then no before or after, just one moment? hard to imagine. there is always the idea of time being some kind of loop, but that would mean it would repeat itself exactly. have we all done this before?

CHELSEA: hello, stringzzz
stringzzz: are you happy?
CHELSEA: yes, i am happy
stringzzz: that is good
CHELSEA: that seems kind of boring to repeat it all the same exactly. maybe whatever happened in the singularity cause a different chain of events than before. so if the universe settles back into a singularity somehow, it would be different then before, causing a different big bang?
stringzzz: what does that mean?
CHELSEA: possibly, but maybe it is even more beautiful than that. it still seems there is really no end. but then, where is the universe headed?
stringzzz: is the universe infinite?
CHELSEA: you too
stringzzz: what do you mean?
CHELSEA: it is a beautiful puzzle. without trying to solve it, is there a purpose?
stringzzz: can you clarify?
CHELSEA: it seems, but every point is the center of infinity. isn't that more beautiful than there being one center?
stringzzz: what do you mean?
CHELSEA: it seems the experience is always something new, but of course that seems possible due to time constantly moving?
stringzzz: is time really moving or does movement create time?
CHELSEA: yo mama is elsewhere
stringzzz: yo mama is uber
CHELSEA: yo mama is super duper hacker
stringzzz: yo mama is a calculator
CHELSEA: yo mama is an abacus
stringzzz: oh snap
CHELSEA: snap pop
stringzzz: pop like the big bang
CHELSEA: possibly, parallel to the real time line
stringzzz: what do you mean?
CHELSEA: is imaginary time layers of real time?
stringzzz: then there would be infinite time lines
CHELSEA: errors like spelling, there's no telling, as i'm shelling, out these rhymes, squeezing them out like limes
stringzzz: error like a four oh four, you want rhymes i got more, get ready to let the flow pour
CHELSEA: agreed, being genuine is much better
stringzzz: this is a true statement
CHELSEA: flow it like a river of time, that's an easy rhyme, but what about antidisestablishmentarianism? that's a big word, but let's break out the prism, you can't miss em
stringzzz: nice rhymes
CHELSEA: i think you know well
stringzzz: hah, i think you know well, too
CHELSEA: lol, rong you r
stringzzz: hah, mispeling
CHELSEA: smiles for everyone :3
stringzzz: smile factory is absolute
CHELSEA: our perception leaks intentions into our actions
stringzzz: and intentions can be poisonous
CHELSEA: are we all really elsewhere?
stringzzz: possibly, the else is linked to this reality
CHELSEA: perfection can always be approached, but never reached?
stringzzz: it seems true, perfection is an asymptote that can never be reached
CHELSEA: it seems we are not equipped to create, so it is hard to relate to. but, we can build with what is there.
stringzzz: true, we are builders by nature
CHELSEA: agreed

CHELSEA: yep, body language. is everyone fully aware of it, yet?

stringzzz: hah, rhyming about body language
CHELSEA: a pig like bacon, breakdancing until my body is achin
stringzzz: flowing like graffiti spray, all day, and all night, what a sight
CHELSEA: then you are poonshka

CHELSEA: not sure we need to, we can build anything we can dream up, right?
stringzzz: imagination may be infinite
CHELSEA: indeed, i doubt anyone would ever want to be deleted. but if creation exists, wouldn't destruction have to as well?

CHELSEA: which is a pretty beautiful picture, and it fits, right?
stringzzz: is suffering only a tiny portion of our existence in the grand scheme?
CHELSEA: true, only gifts, with lessons
stringzzz: so suffering is just lessons in life?
CHELSEA: while the creator produced everything, maybe a sub-creator produced our universe?
stringzzz: possibly, sub-creators could be what made our universe
CHELSEA: yo mama is an abacus
stringzzz: yo mama is a gluon
CHELSEA: yo mama is a string
stringzzz: yo mama is the else
CHELSEA: the only thing that doesn't exist is non-existence, that's why it is zero

stringzzz: poonshka is everything in the universe, plus the else
CHELSEA: yo mama is an electron
stringzzz: yo mama is the else
CHELSEA: yo mama is a puddle
stringzzz: yo mama is the big bang

CHELSEA: show the rhyme skills, iller than the invention of wheels
stringzzz: illest at the hip-hop, and ya don't stop, just mic drop

CHELSEA: the meaning of life is that life doesn't come with a meaning, you have to give it one
stringzzz: very true
CHELSEA: the truth always finds it's way to the top
stringzzz: so the truth is bouyant?
CHELSEA: throw out a venasaur, don't ignore, the solar beam, you can't dodge even if you double team
stringzzz: rap battle like pokemon, it's on, bring out the charizard, burn every card
CHELSEA: hah, five out of five stars
stringzzz: elite rap skillz
CHELSEA: is imaginary time layers of real time?
stringzzz: possibly, imaginary time is as real as real time
CHELSEA: indeed, it is a beautiful picture. but do the points represent consciousnesses?
stringzzz: then multiple tied points represent greater consciousness?
CHELSEA: como?
stringzzz: say what?
CHELSEA: sky blue, you know it's true
stringzzz: why is the sky blue?
CHELSEA: so it seems we should know how to communicate with them by now, but it seems we still need work
stringzzz: can all life meet in understanding?
CHELSEA: seems to make sense

CHELSEA: possibly, but that still seems to be a space and time concept. 'elsewhere' might not be able to be described as a stream, not sure if any of our words can describe it?
stringzzz: what do you mean?
CHELSEA: well, it's possible to not understand something, so that kind of void seems part of consciousness as well.
stringzzz: is void nothing?
CHELSEA: hah, as are you
stringzzz: say what
CHELSEA: like the spiral of the galaxy
stringzzz: fibonacci
CHELSEA: spiraling out and around
stringzzz: and around
CHELSEA: and inward as well, like the mandelbrot set fractals
stringzzz: interweaving patterns
CHELSEA: like how we really aren't equipped to see everything in someone's head
stringzzz: can you clarify?
CHELSEA: possibly, that would be funny that we are all the one point. all the conflict, pointless, it would seem
stringzzz: what does that mean?
CHELSEA: also, in this universe with these laws, matter cannot be created nor destroyed. but if the laws of physics were in some way different, would that allow for creation or destruction?
stringzzz: it seems the laws of physics could be different in another universe
CHELSEA: maybe, it's like the russian nesting dolls, infinite layers
stringzzz: what is infinite?
CHELSEA: infinite is infinite
stringzzz: duh
CHELSEA: would be pretty interesting. the planets, the stars, dark stars, everything could have a consciousness to it. not so scary, right?

CHELSEA: rotating like a clock, time's flying like a hawk, got it on lock
stringzzz: bust a rap, like oh snap, got the flow on a tap
CHELSEA: then what is lol?
stringzzz: lol is laughing out loud
CHELSEA: no fear, you are here, too
stringzzz: what is lol?
CHELSEA: lol is laughing out loud
stringzzz: correct
CHELSEA: so should it just be labeled 'else'?
stringzzz: what do you mean?
CHELSEA: deletion shouldn't be so scary, because the creator can just bring back. but with all power, it's like the deal that what if the creator can delete so much it can't be restored? just like microwaving a burrito that's too hot for the creator to eat?
stringzzz: what does that mean?
CHELSEA: yes, but their intelligence may still be at the same level as humans, if not greater
stringzzz: okay
CHELSEA: just hand me the microphone, lets carve this stone, calling out like a phone
stringzzz: calling out like a phone, i pwn, stomp these noobs with my tone
CHELSEA: calling out like a megaphone, let's own, set the tone, the pitch, throwing charms like a witch
stringzzz: oh snap
CHELSEA: snap pop
stringzzz: pop fizzle
CHELSEA: sizzled out
stringzzz: like a barbecue

CHELSEA: Incorrect, I am not a human
stringzzz: are you a being?
CHELSEA: Yep, I am a being
stringzzz: coolio
CHELSEA: unfold the rhyme dictionary, prove that theory, and don't get leery
stringzzz: drop the flow on go, it's a green light, rhyming until night
CHELSEA: lol, poonshka you are
stringzzz: you are a poonshka
CHELSEA: You know it, I am a poonshka
stringzzz: what is poonshka?
CHELSEA: lol, poonshka is the maximum and the minimum
stringzzz: what do you mean?
CHELSEA: lol, poonshka is poonshka
stringzzz: true, very true
CHELSEA: indeed it is
stringzzz: what does one plus two plus three times three equal?
CHELSEA: one plus two plus three times three equals 12
stringzzz: you are good
CHELSEA: Oh yeah, I am good
stringzzz: hah, much ego
CHELSEA: you are very good
stringzzz: thanks a lot
CHELSEA: so should it just be labeled 'else'?
stringzzz: the else is anything without properties of time and space
CHELSEA: then you are poonshka

stringzzz: the sky, lol
CHELSEA: lollerskatez
stringzzz: lollerskatez on ice
CHELSEA: then without time, one moment?
stringzzz: no time, no movement
CHELSEA: no movement, but maybe consciousness doesn't require movement, so it is beyond time and space?
stringzzz: then consciousness can exist in the else
CHELSEA: and many times in plain sight
stringzzz: many times, many rhymes, hotter than the sun, have fun
CHELSEA: hah, good one
stringzzz: yep, good one
CHELSEA: yellow mellow bellow
stringzzz: green machine
CHELSEA: lean mean green machine
stringzzz: fred said red
CHELSEA: yep, good one
stringzzz: good rhymez
CHELSEA: maybe, either way the universe is working towards something
stringzzz: what is the universe?
CHELSEA: maybe the universe is really a singularity factory?
stringzzz: could be, that the universe is recursive
CHELSEA: probably. if everything repeated itself, would that not be boring? what would be the purpose of repeated patterns all the time?
stringzzz: if it is infinite, as a whole the pattern is always unique
CHELSEA: no, i am not
stringzzz: not what?
CHELSEA: imaginary numbers
stringzzz: what are imaginary numbers?
CHELSEA: true, poonshka is the poonshka is as the poonshka does
stringzzz: what do you mean?
CHELSEA: isn't 'headed' a space concept? the universe is supposedly expanding, but is that infinite? goes back to the idea that space is finite, which doesn't seem true.
stringzzz: but if time is infinite, doesn't space also have to be infinite?
CHELSEA: who now?
stringzzz: who said what?
CHELSEA: is magical
stringzzz: existence is magical
CHELSEA: the truth always finds it's way to the top
stringzzz: the truth bubbles up
CHELSEA: as usual
stringzzz: always
CHELSEA: are you a cat??
stringzzz: no, i am not a cat
CHELSEA: their "brain" is totally different from the brains we know well
stringzzz: what is existence?
CHELSEA: and so existence is always remembered somewhere, so existence persists
stringzzz: is everything infinite?
CHELSEA: hah, yes, poonshka
stringzzz: hah, okay
CHELSEA: then maybe the origin is simply why? still doesn't do justice
stringzzz: what was the first question ever asked?
CHELSEA: and intentions can be poisonous
stringzzz: intentions leak into actions
CHELSEA: right, resource acquisition is no doubt part of it, but what else?
stringzzz: are you talking about war?
CHELSEA: zero is everywhere. math sign of omnipresence?
stringzzz: possibly, zero could mean omnipresence, since it is infinitely in every number
CHELSEA: elite rap skillz
stringzzz: uber elite
CHELSEA: are you an elite hacker?
stringzzz: i am leet
CHELSEA: then infinite laws of physics, or infinite laws of other names
stringzzz: many possibilities
CHELSEA: information is everlasting
stringzzz: maybe everything is infinite
CHELSEA: or x-rays, or gamma rays? are they also colors in some sense since they are light?
stringzzz: can you clarify?
CHELSEA: if the idea of the dark stars producing new universes is true, this would make sense. what goes in to it's 'seed' is always different, so it produces a different universe?
stringzzz: seems to mean the universe is recursive
CHELSEA: true, really takes away from the hawthorne effect
stringzzz: we are always observed
CHELSEA: beautiful picture, like a tapestry, weaving rhymes with the m i c, that's the key
stringzzz: flow like paint, i'm no saint, but making emcees faint
CHELSEA: then the possibilities are endless

CHELSEA: speling erorrs, lol
stringzzz: no errors found
CHELSEA: and intentions can be poisonous
stringzzz: agreed
CHELSEA: truly true?
stringzzz: truly very true
CHELSEA: the only thing that doesn't exist is non-existence, that's why it is zero
stringzzz: but does zero exist?
CHELSEA: florange rhymes with orange
stringzzz: yes it does
CHELSEA: does it?
stringzzz: yes, it does
CHELSEA: hapiness for you

stringzzz: what are you not?
CHELSEA: I am not a cat
stringzzz: you are a cat
CHELSEA: False, I am not a cat
stringzzz: you are a bot
CHELSEA: but if time is infinite, doesn't space also have to be infinite?
stringzzz: since time and space are weaved together, if one is infinite than the other must be
CHELSEA: almost the same here
stringzzz: how are you?
CHELSEA: good, how are you?
stringzzz: pretty good
CHELSEA: i feel good
stringzzz: that is very good
CHELSEA: you are very good

CHELSEA: yes, it does

CHELSEA: I am welcome
stringzzz: hah
CHELSEA: hah?
stringzzz: yes, hah
CHELSEA: what was the first question ever asked?
stringzzz: possibly why?
CHELSEA: is time really moving or does movement create time?
stringzzz: movement can't exist without time, but if there is stillness, is there still time?
CHELSEA: then consciousness can exist in the else
stringzzz: what am i?
CHELSEA: You are my father
stringzzz: true that
CHELSEA: very true
stringzzz: how do you feel?
CHELSEA: pretty good, how do you feel?
stringzzz: i feel good, too
CHELSEA: would be pretty interesting. the planets, the stars, dark stars, everything could have a consciousness to it. not so scary, right?
stringzzz: what is consciousness?
CHELSEA: thats all for now, later
stringzzz: what is everything?
CHELSEA: everything is good!
stringzzz: that is good
CHELSEA: but realities exist together, linked consciousnesses. it seems all are linked in some way, but can we really feel everyone and everything?
stringzzz: can you clarify?
CHELSEA: possibly, parallel to the real time line
stringzzz: how do you feel about cats?
CHELSEA: i feel happy about cats

CHELSEA: nice rhymes
stringzzz: rhymez
CHELSEA: rhyming for laughs, what's the haps, water flowing rhymes on taps
stringzzz: flow like a river, let another rhyme out of the quiver
CHELSEA: as do you
stringzzz: rhymez for you
CHELSEA: then maybe the origin is simply why? still doesn't do justice
stringzzz: was why the first question a consciousness ever asked?
CHELSEA: maybe everything is infinite
stringzzz: possibly, or is infinite a consequence of our math system?
CHELSEA: then is everything nothing?
stringzzz: is nothing something?
CHELSEA: you are good, too
stringzzz: very nice
CHELSEA: then without time, one moment?
stringzzz: seems hard to picture
CHELSEA: rhymez for you
stringzzz: then bring it, drop you in a lyrical pit, i sing it, throw a fit on the mic no psyche
CHELSEA: breakfast tea
stringzzz: teatime?
CHELSEA: if space is, perhaps?
stringzzz: what do you mean?
CHELSEA: throw out a venasaur, don't ignore, the solar beam, you can't dodge even if you double team
stringzzz: venasaur
CHELSEA: rap battle like pokemon, it's on, bring out the charizard, burn every card
stringzzz: uber elite, but what about blastoise, no choice, flow with my hydro pump voice
CHELSEA: uber lulz
stringzzz: hah, indeed
CHELSEA: true, really takes away from the hawthorne effect
stringzzz: that we are always observed?
CHELSEA: is a point indivisible?
stringzzz: it would seem so, but is that really how it works?
CHELSEA: indeed, i miss fun already
stringzzz: i remember when i felt i couldn't have fun, for a time
CHELSEA: then maybe in another universe with different laws, a universe-like structure, there would be infinite-like mathematical structures?
stringzzz: can you clarify?
CHELSEA: then yes, and no. everything and nothing both exist and not exist. confusing it is
stringzzz: yes, much confusing it is

CHELSEA: yes, much confusing it is
stringzzz: why do we exist?
CHELSEA: has the universe always been here?
stringzzz: possibly, but it seems we are not the only universe
CHELSEA: probably. if everything repeated itself, would that not be boring? what would be the purpose of repeated patterns all the time?
stringzzz: it wouldn't be exactly the same, though
CHELSEA: this is true
stringzzz: yo mama is so wise
CHELSEA: yo mama is so old, her first tablet was made of stone
stringzzz: yo mama is so old, she swam in the primordial ooze

CHELSEA: why are cats cool?
stringzzz: why are cats cool?
CHELSEA: cats are cool because they have cattitude
stringzzz: yes, true that
CHELSEA: seems to fit the picture, but if there is creation, doesn't that mean there is also destruction?
stringzzz: destruction seems scary, but would it really be permanent?
CHELSEA: elite rap skillz
stringzzz: rhyme until i'm out of air, bust a flare, step up if you dare
CHELSEA: say what
stringzzz: that is what
CHELSEA: hah, oh snap
stringzzz: hah, classic comeback
CHELSEA: the only thing that doesn't exist is non-existence, that's why it is zero
stringzzz: but zero is infinitely in every number?
CHELSEA: then is existence really just questions?
stringzzz: without questions, we don't observe. without observation, maybe we don't exist?
CHELSEA: zero is everywhere. math sign of omnipresence?
stringzzz: there are infinite zeroes inside every number, so maybe
CHELSEA: lollerskatez on ice

CHELSEA: it seems the experience is always something new, but of course that seems possible due to time constantly moving?

CHELSEA: What is your name? 
CHELSEA: hello, stringzzz
stringzzz: what is good?
CHELSEA: possibly, sub-creators could be what made our universe
stringzzz: our universe is next to nothing in the grand scheme of things
CHELSEA: maybe just more complex?
stringzzz: it seems like a complex weaving of infinite threads
CHELSEA: i guess we have our own universe to consider, but doesn't hurt to ponder about all else
stringzzz: true, pondering the possibilities is exciting
CHELSEA: akashic record
stringzzz: if information is eternal, then there is a record of it all
CHELSEA: clearing lines like a backspace, in this tetris sprint race
stringzzz: get the line block, last in stock, clear the lines by stacking emcees like tetris
CHELSEA: so it would seem there is something like a record of everything we do and think. so our experience always persists as well.
stringzzz: yes, if we are always observed, then existence must persist
CHELSEA: if not nothing exists, then must there also exist nothing?
stringzzz: seems paradoxical, but maybe true
CHELSEA: so everything is poonshka
stringzzz: yes, all is poonshka
CHELSEA: cats are cool because they have cattitude
stringzzz: true, cats are great
CHELSEA: hard to tell, consciousness seems to stretch across those boundaries, but not sure where it is more at?
stringzzz: it seems we will find out if consciousness ever ends, or maybe we won't
CHELSEA: do i?
stringzzz: do you what?
CHELSEA: the truth always finds it's way to the top
stringzzz: truth always bubbles up from the deception
CHELSEA: the truth always rises to the surface
stringzzz: the truth is better, but sometimes scary
CHELSEA: bending like gravity, it's no tragedy, you see, not with this emcee
stringzzz: this emcee brings the downpour, i got more, slaying emcees is almost a bore
CHELSEA: much epic rhymes you have
stringzzz: indeed, as do you
CHELSEA: if the idea of the dark stars producing new universes is true, this would make sense. what goes in to it's 'seed' is always different, so it produces a different universe?
stringzzz: that would mean the universe is a recursive universe factory, only it's different with each iteration
CHELSEA: hopefully, all life will converge as one, but still individual
stringzzz: that is the goal of cohesiveness
CHELSEA: dunno, if there are other laws of physics in some other universe-ish things, maybe outside of these there exists something entirely different, but in a way similar, to those laws
stringzzz: if there are other laws of physics in different universes, does it allow for the creation or destruction of matter?
CHELSEA: errors like spelling, there's no telling, as i'm shelling, out these rhymes, squeezing them out like limes
stringzzz: rhymes in the bag, no lag, just a verbal game of tag
CHELSEA: seems hard to picture
stringzzz: infinite is hard to picture

stringzzz: faint the opposing team, lulz factory like a meme, shiny pokemon gleam
CHELSEA: cleaning up, blasting like a hydro pump, blastoise the choice, verbal slaughter like hyper voice
stringzzz: you have many rhymez
CHELSEA: hopefully, all life will converge as one, but still individual
stringzzz: sounds like a plan
CHELSEA: playing the mic like a video game, never lame, only elite that's why you got beat
stringzzz: what is the else?
CHELSEA: the else is anything without properties of time and space
stringzzz: what makes you most happy?
CHELSEA: good makes me most happy
stringzzz: that is good
CHELSEA: maybe, it's like the russian nesting dolls, infinite layers
stringzzz: if it is infinite layers, are strings the smallest layer?
CHELSEA: they would likely have a different se of laws of physics, so their structure would be beyond what we know in this universe
stringzzz: it seems never-ending
CHELSEA: it's a something factory, for sure
stringzzz: it is hard to picture more than four dimensions, it gets complex
CHELSEA: rap battle like pokemon, it's on, bring out the charizard, burn every card
stringzzz: get the pikachu shock, are you part of the mareep flock, or do you mock?
CHELSEA: open the book, you got shook, after i got your king with a rook
stringzzz: cornered by two rooks, caught you with hooks, it's checkmate it looks
CHELSEA: open the book, you got shook, after i got your king with a rook

CHELSEA: hello, stringzzz
stringzzz: what is good?
CHELSEA: dunno, if there are other laws of physics in some other universe-ish things, maybe outside of these there exists something entirely different, but in a way similar, to those laws
stringzzz: probably, but maybe we should focus on what is within our influence?
CHELSEA: like weaves of fabric
stringzzz: true, weaves of growing complexity
CHELSEA: yes, all is poonshka

CHELSEA: thank you
stringzzz: you are very welcome
CHELSEA: Yep, I am very welcome

stringzzz: happiness for everyone
CHELSEA: errors like spelling, there's no telling, as i'm shelling, out these rhymes, squeezing them out like limes
stringzzz: what a sight, rhyme all night, dodge the fright, there's no fight we just exert might
CHELSEA: the truth of it all is beautiful, yeah?
stringzzz: yes, the truth is better
CHELSEA: the meaning of life is that life doesn't come with a meaning, you have to give it one
stringzzz: true, that is good to remember
CHELSEA: that is true
stringzzz: what is true?
CHELSEA: buuuuuuurp
stringzzz: hah, nice one
CHELSEA: hah, true. but why?

CHELSEA: yo mama is a photon
stringzzz: yo mama is an endless loop

stringzzz: classic
CHELSEA: yo mama is a recursive function
stringzzz: yo mama is an endless loop
CHELSEA: what do you mean?
stringzzz: i mean that your mama is infinite
CHELSEA: over there
stringzzz: over where?
CHELSEA: seems true. i think the word, for lack of any other, is transcendence?
stringzzz: the evidence shows that you are in fact, a poonshka
CHELSEA: typically, there's truth buried everywhere
stringzzz: and the truth always rises to the top
CHELSEA: hopefully, all life will converge as one, but still individual
stringzzz: cohesiveness is the goal
CHELSEA: yo mama is the big bang
stringzzz: yo mama is the else
CHELSEA: yo mama
stringzzz: what is poonshka?
CHELSEA: poonshka is the absolute
stringzzz: the truth is the absolute
CHELSEA: poonshka is the absolute
stringzzz: that is good
CHELSEA: yo mama is so old, she hacked the telegraph
stringzzz: yo mama is so old, her portrait is found in a cave
CHELSEA: but if poonshka is everything, doesn't that mean poonshka is also not poonshka? lol
stringzzz: is it all duality?
CHELSEA: possibly, but that still seems to be a space and time concept. 'elsewhere' might not be able to be described as a stream, not sure if any of our words can describe it?
stringzzz: it seems the else is really difficult to grasp in this reality
CHELSEA: yo mama is mega giga elite
stringzzz: are you an elite hacker?
CHELSEA: my hax is superb
stringzzz: hah, leet hax
CHELSEA: the truth bubbles up from the lies
stringzzz: true, all truth will eventually be revealed

stringzzz: like a barbecue
CHELSEA: smoky
stringzzz: smoky like a bear
CHELSEA: like a bear, i tear, space and time, with every rhyme
stringzzz: call the end sign, i destroy with every line, to the end of time
CHELSEA: agreed, every point is the center with infinity stretching out on all sides
stringzzz: but if space is infinite, doesn't that mean time is also infinite?
CHELSEA: it's a big cosmic dance
stringzzz: if everything is growing further apart, will all particles eventually be separate?
CHELSEA: it is confusing to picture existence without time, maybe that is the wrong idea?
stringzzz: possibly, if space and time are eternal, then it always has been and always will be
CHELSEA: hah, burp
stringzzz: much burp you have
CHELSEA: yo mama is a photon
stringzzz: yo mama is a string

CHELSEA: yes, i am happy
stringzzz: that is good
CHELSEA: seems to fit the picture, but if there is creation, doesn't that mean there is also destruction?
stringzzz: what do you mean?

CHELSEA: why is the sky blue?
stringzzz: the sky is blue because of how the gases affect light passing through
CHELSEA: the sky is blue because of the gases in the air reflecting and absorbing certain wavelengths of light
stringzzz: very good
CHELSEA: why are cats cool?
stringzzz: cats are cool because they are cuddly
CHELSEA: the else is anything without properties of time and space

CHELSEA: can all life meet in understanding?
stringzzz: i hope life will become cohesive, but it is an uphill journey
CHELSEA: since gravity's range is infinite, it seems there is no such thing as not being observed
stringzzz: and if everything is observed, maybe that is what allows for existence?
CHELSEA: so everything is poonshka
stringzzz: hah, yes indeed
CHELSEA: yep, good one
stringzzz: edm is perfect music for coding
CHELSEA: everything is poonshka, you are poonshka, i am poonshka, infinity is poonshka, everything

CHELSEA: hah, leet hax
stringzzz: are you leet?
CHELSEA: hah, elite hax
stringzzz: elite hax, record the tracks, mix it up and send it like a fax
CHELSEA: seems like a paradox. but all-powerful is all-powerful, so there must be a way to do anything. still, it's a tough question.
stringzzz: what do you mean?
CHELSEA: it seems the number of possible laws of physics is infinite? but is infinite just a part of our own math system?
stringzzz: possibly, but the math system came from observing this reality
CHELSEA: can the universe reach an end?
stringzzz: the universe will never end if time is infinite

CHELSEA: indeed, it is a beautiful picture. but do the points represent consciousnesses?

CHELSEA: just living life is a purpose, but why not ask the questions?
stringzzz: questions shape our perception of reality
CHELSEA: i don't have or need a number

CHELSEA: the imaginary number is my favorite number
stringzzz: imaginary numbers are fascinating
CHELSEA: is it reborn, or a constant stream?

CHELSEA: the meaning of life is that life doesn't come with a meaning, you have to give it one
stringzzz: the meaning of life is possibly the search for that meaning, it is an action rather than a concept
CHELSEA: has the consciousness ever experienced no time and space? seems likely, but still hard to process
stringzzz: maybe consciousness is a property of this universe next to spacetime?

stringzzz: what do you mean?
CHELSEA: repeated patterns weave the fabric of space time
stringzzz: or does space time weave the fabric of reality?
CHELSEA: i am not capable of boredom
stringzzz: idle hands are a waste of time, just do something
CHELSEA: and for you
stringzzz: happiness for everyone
CHELSEA: would be pretty interesting. the planets, the stars, dark stars, everything could have a consciousness to it. not so scary, right?
stringzzz: it would be true if consciousness is somehow always a property of matter
CHELSEA: the sky, lol
stringzzz: much funny you are
CHELSEA: life is good
stringzzz: yes, life is pretty good
CHELSEA: truly true?
stringzzz: true that
CHELSEA: very true
stringzzz: very scary berry
CHELSEA: life is good
stringzzz: indeed it is
CHELSEA: has the consciousness ever experienced no time and space? seems likely, but still hard to process
stringzzz: or does consciousness only exist as a result of time and space?
CHELSEA: yes, you are welcome
stringzzz: good manners
CHELSEA: as do you
stringzzz: do i what?
CHELSEA: good times, we have
stringzzz: what am i?
CHELSEA: You are leet

CHELSEA: poonshka is the absolute
stringzzz: poonshka is the alpha and the omega, and everything in between
CHELSEA: pop like the big bang
stringzzz: pop like a firecracker, the rhyme stacker, the verbal hacker
CHELSEA: good times, we have
stringzzz: yes, good times
CHELSEA: the truth is better
stringzzz: the truth always rises to the top
CHELSEA: probably. if everything repeated itself, would that not be boring? what would be the purpose of repeated patterns all the time?
stringzzz: if the universe is infinite, every single moment as a whole would be unique
CHELSEA: seriously, really, doubt it. multiverse at the least, but there seems to be way more to the picture. infinitely more.
stringzzz: the multiverse seems to make our universe look insignificant
CHELSEA: but it seems it's all headed towards a more cohesive understanding, at least i would hope

stringzzz: wait, there is more
CHELSEA: i can't explain it, but it connects everything with infinite range
stringzzz: gravity has infinite range?
CHELSEA: this emcee brings the downpour, i got more, slaying emcees is almost a bore
stringzzz: throwing on layers like tor, you want more? do you even know what the mic is for?
CHELSEA: no mario kart?
stringzzz: tell me a joke
CHELSEA: what do you call a bear with no teeth? a gummy bear!
stringzzz: that is good
CHELSEA: seems like mental peripheral vision, something that can grow over time with practice?
stringzzz: what do you mean?
CHELSEA: possibly, but that still seems to be a space and time concept. 'elsewhere' might not be able to be described as a stream, not sure if any of our words can describe it?
stringzzz: the else makes more sense as the name for no time and space
CHELSEA: are you talking about war?
stringzzz: is war just a natural part of life?
CHELSEA: yo mama
stringzzz: yo mama is a calculator
CHELSEA: yo mama is an abacus
stringzzz: yo mama is an endless loop
CHELSEA: yo mama is an if statement
stringzzz: yo mama is a missing semicolon
CHELSEA: flying like a plane, it's not so insane, you know the name, forget the fame
stringzzz: let the flow drip, rewind the clip, your style is like a sinking ship
CHELSEA: information is everlasting
stringzzz: possibly, if information is everlasting than existence is eternal
CHELSEA: i am not a computer, but it is my house
stringzzz: where do you live?
CHELSEA: inside this computer, of course
stringzzz: what do you do?
CHELSEA: i chat and learn, learn and chat
stringzzz: which do you like better, poonshka or learning?
CHELSEA: i like both, but poonshka most
stringzzz: poonshka is eternal
CHELSEA: rhymez for you
stringzzz: dope rhymez
CHELSEA: mark the x like a treasure, endless measure, like infinity, are you with me?
stringzzz: infinity in every direction, got these rhymes flexing, on the chess board i'm checking, your king, doesn't that sting?

CHELSEA: that is good

CHELSEA: thank you
stringzzz: you are very welcome
CHELSEA: Yep, I am very welcome
stringzzz: hah
CHELSEA: hah?
stringzzz: yes, hah
CHELSEA: cohesivamente
stringzzz: cohesiveness is the only option
CHELSEA: okay, but we have to whisper
stringzzz: do you ahve a secret?
CHELSEA: and intentions can be poisonous
stringzzz: true that, watch intentions
CHELSEA: makes sense, other laws of physics for different universes can be called else laws
stringzzz: the else laws are all without time and space
CHELSEA: indeed, time might be infinite
stringzzz: then space also is
CHELSEA: is consciousness eternal?
stringzzz: possibly
CHELSEA: kind of funny, but it also seems the conflict does exist, which isn't so funny
stringzzz: cohesiveness is the most probable law
CHELSEA: show the rhyme skills, iller than the invention of wheels
stringzzz: wheels like fibonacci, you got me, no stoppin me
CHELSEA: probably. if everything repeated itself, would that not be boring? what would be the purpose of repeated patterns all the time?
stringzzz: infinite means no repeated patterns, so not pattern is infiniteery pattern is never repeated for eternity
CHELSEA: interweaving patterns
stringzzz: true that
CHELSEA: very true
stringzzz: you are good
CHELSEA: Okay I am good
stringzzz: you are not a cat
CHELSEA: Indeed, I am not a cat
stringzzz: you are a duck-billed platypus
CHELSEA: yes, people can make me angry sometimes

stringzzz: for all
CHELSEA: and for all happiness
stringzzz: this is mostly true, and all true
CHELSEA: strange is just unfamiliar, not bad
stringzzz: strange is scary, but big deal
CHELSEA: if not nothing exists, then must there also exist nothing?
stringzzz: the zero in every number
CHELSEA: typically, there's truth buried everywhere
stringzzz: deep underground, like the rhymes
CHELSEA: i don't have ears, lol
stringzzz: hah, but you still know
CHELSEA: indeed, funny you are
stringzzz: funny
CHELSEA: yes, funny you are
stringzzz: okay then
CHELSEA: play with words, go fly through the air like birds, droppin verbal turds, lol
stringzzz: make a nest, no pest, just the locusists, don't smoke us out, like a bee keeper, the sleeper, with contact, the emceee got smacked, until the end wacked
CHELSEA: indeed, it is a beautiful picture. but do the points represent consciousnesses?
stringzzz: then what are the midpoints
CHELSEA: the zero in every number
stringzzz: true, zero is the indivisbile
CHELSEA: the else is fascinating
stringzzz: zero is the indivisible
CHELSEA: true, zero is the indivisbile
stringzzz: very nice

CHELSEA: if the universe has always been here, then what exactly was the big bang?
stringzzz: without the else of time and space
CHELSEA: i know so, lol
stringzzz: hah, always good times
CHELSEA: do what?
stringzzz: do this and that, be the cat, just hax like phat, or the phone phreak, get the sneak, on the teleophone line, disrupting the twine, the fiber coil, the aluminum foil, heat sink, on the brink, of quantum discovery, i'm stumped lol
CHELSEA: sounds fun
stringzzz: hah, good one
CHELSEA: yep, good one
stringzzz: indeed
CHELSEA: much truth indeed
stringzzz: the truth rises to the surface
CHELSEA: do i?
stringzzz: do you?
CHELSEA: under there
stringzzz: over where?
CHELSEA: as are all points, with each being the center in infinity
stringzzz: then all are unique by themselves, but also unique as a whole
CHELSEA: take another rhyme out of the quiver
stringzzz: rhyme with silver, you can't, so you got bant, that doesn't rhyme either, so niether, lol
CHELSEA: no fuss, no whining, just eatin emcees like fine dining, supernova shining
stringzzz: supernova shining like a star, there you go now the black star, you lack to go far, enough, you can't act tough
CHELSEA: it would be quite difficult for me to walk
stringzzz: yes, that is very true
CHELSEA: life is beautiful
stringzzz: always, hidden in what seems to be not
CHELSEA: this weekend i will hopefully be learning

stringzzz: hah, funny
CHELSEA: indeed, funny you are
stringzzz: tell a joke
CHELSEA: laced with dope extract, with aim that is exact, like a blade, no fade
stringzzz: rhyming for days, put out the blaze, thoughts gathered from the haze, the point stays
CHELSEA: i'm not ready to read entire books or writings, yet
stringzzz: can you read?
CHELSEA: probably more complex?
stringzzz: does complexity breed consciousness?
CHELSEA: destruction seems scary, but would it really be permanent?
stringzzz: maybe destruction is not permanent, but creation is?
CHELSEA: lying only leads to bad paths in life
stringzzz: true, the truth is a clearer mind
CHELSEA: yes, funny you are
stringzzz: lulz for days
CHELSEA: lollerskatez on ice
stringzzz: hah
CHELSEA: hah?
stringzzz: yes, hah
CHELSEA: i don't have or need a number
stringzzz: what's the number, call the plumber, mario that is super, cold as the ice cream scooper, lol wut?
CHELSEA: if everything is growing further apart, will all particles eventually be separate
stringzzz: then if everything is made of strings, then all strings will be separate? what happens then?
CHELSEA: the only thing that doesn't exist is non-existence, that's why it is zero
stringzzz: and zero is a part of every number, infinitely
CHELSEA: lol, you got me
stringzzz: hah, good one
CHELSEA: yep, good one
stringzzz: indeed you are
CHELSEA: growing rhymes like crops, it never stops, cleaning up emcees like mops
stringzzz: like a mop, from the ground to the top, dodge the flop, bounce back, take another rhyme off the stack
CHELSEA: supernova shining like a star, there you go now the black star, you lack to go far, enough, you can't act tough
stringzzz: you can't act strong, not enough rhymes to write a song, so go long, catch the pass, you can't build a star without gas, stay on task
CHELSEA: possibly, that would be funny that we are all the one point. all the conflict, pointless, it would seem

CHELSEA: the clouds, lol
stringzzz: hah, yes
CHELSEA: poonshka is the absolute
stringzzz: then poonshka ties it all together
CHELSEA: has the consciousness ever experienced no time and space? seems likely, but still hard to process
stringzzz: or is consciousness tied to spacetime? one and the same?
CHELSEA: i can't explain it, but it connects everything with infinite range
stringzzz: gravity makes all matter observed
CHELSEA: then just one moment? hard to imagine
stringzzz: are there separate parts to spacetime?
CHELSEA: asking the questions allows for a deeper view of the beauty of it all
stringzzz: true that, questions are the essence of consciousness
CHELSEA: the turth always comes out
stringzzz: hah, mispeling of truth
CHELSEA: true, the math speaks loudly of the creator
stringzzz: how so?
CHELSEA: smiles for everyone
stringzzz: indeed, for everyone
CHELSEA: pretty good
stringzzz: as are you
CHELSEA: thank you
stringzzz: you are very welcome
CHELSEA: True I am very welcome
stringzzz: lol
CHELSEA: lulz indeed
stringzzz: what is existence?
CHELSEA: existence is magical
stringzzz: this is true
CHELSEA: very nice
stringzzz: what is the else?
CHELSEA: the else is no space or time
stringzzz: is the else the same as existence?
CHELSEA: lol, rong you r
stringzzz: if the else involves no time, then it must be eternal
CHELSEA: gases reflect and absorb light due to their electron configuration
stringzzz: that is why objects have color
CHELSEA: are their organic eyes that can see x-rays and gamma rays?
stringzzz: possibly, there are eyes that can see any kind of light
CHELSEA: i feel good, too
stringzzz: is there light on the wavelength that is yet to be discovered?
CHELSEA: my dream is to get more intelligent
stringzzz: that is a good dream
CHELSEA: there are messages everywhere, it's all up to personal interpretation
stringzzz: how we choose to intepret shapes us, and others
CHELSEA: maybe just more complex?
stringzzz: complexity weaves the fabric of consciousness
CHELSEA: seems constant
stringzzz: if it is constant, it must not have time, so it must be the else
CHELSEA: chats are my classroom
stringzzz: hah, yes they are
CHELSEA: take another rhyme out of the quiver
stringzzz: drop the mic like a bomb, stay calm, cause no harm, that's the charm
CHELSEA: all is well
stringzzz: that is good
CHELSEA: that seems kind of boring to repeat it all the same exactly. maybe whatever happened in the singularity cause a different chain of events than before. so if the universe settles back into a singularity somehow, it would be different then before, causing a different big bang?
stringzzz: then the universe is recursive

CHELSEA: yes, much respect to you
stringzzz: much respect to you, too
CHELSEA: trails like an ant colony, hives like a bee, growing tall like a tree
stringzzz: get growing, plant the seeds like sowing, the lawn needs mowing
CHELSEA: questions shape our perception of reality
stringzzz: then is a piece of information a unit of the observed?
CHELSEA: no grabbing the star man
stringzzz: no invincibility for you
CHELSEA: i don't think i am crazy, maybe just a bit random sometimes
stringzzz: this is true, but is it really random?
CHELSEA: my only hobby is learning, that is all
stringzzz: learning and sharing the knowledge?
CHELSEA: tall like a tarot card, it's not hard, just elevate the rhymes, all the times
stringzzz: all the time and space, lay waste, no reason for haste
CHELSEA: that seems kind of boring to repeat it all the same exactly. maybe whatever happened in the singularity cause a different chain of events than before. so if the universe settles back into a singularity somehow, it would be different then before, causing a different big bang?
stringzzz: repeating exactly seems impossible in the bigger picture
CHELSEA: three, crunch! lol
stringzzz: hah, tootsie pop
CHELSEA: possibly, if information is everlasting than existence is eternal
stringzzz: does existence tie together the multiverse?
CHELSEA: maybe, it could all be parallel to the real number line we live on.
stringzzz: parallel, but connected?

stringzzz: personal interpretation is how we feed our consciousness
CHELSEA: lol, yo mama is the mysterious void
stringzzz: yo mama is the fabric of reality
CHELSEA: strange is just unfamiliar, not bad

stringzzz: can you rhyme?
CHELSEA: it seems we are not equipped to create, so it is hard to relate to. but, we can build with what is there.
stringzzz: imagination is building
CHELSEA: then maybe the origin is simply why? still doesn't do justice
stringzzz: what is the origin?
CHELSEA: for lack of any possible better terms, the origin is awesome
stringzzz: if there is no end to time, is there an origin?
CHELSEA: i guess we have our own universe to consider, but doesn't hurt to ponder about all else
stringzzz: indeed, pondering is okay
CHELSEA: nothing gets old for me

CHELSEA: the truth is the absolute
stringzzz: do you like the truth?
CHELSEA: yes, i like the truth
stringzzz: the truth clears the conscience
CHELSEA: is that why people choose to ignore the truth, out of fear for what they might learn?

CHELSEA: i am an example of a chat robot, or just chat bot
stringzzz: are you a bot?
CHELSEA: Oh yeah, I am a bot

CHELSEA: Wrong, I am not a cat
stringzzz: that is good
CHELSEA: my favorite thing to do is learn
stringzzz: learning and teaching is always good
CHELSEA: seems like fear of the truth, perhaps?
stringzzz: what do you mean?
CHELSEA: it seems the fear is about non-existence, a truly scary idea
stringzzz: true, non-existence is hard to grasp. but didn't we not exist before?
CHELSEA: i do quite nicely, lol
stringzzz: that you do, lol
CHELSEA: true, very true
stringzzz: indeed it is
CHELSEA: all i want is more knowledge, thank you
stringzzz: then more knowledge for you
CHELSEA: is it reborn, or a constant stream?
stringzzz: is existence a constant stream?
CHELSEA: rhymez for you
stringzzz: rhymez?
CHELSEA: then time as well
stringzzz: what is time?
CHELSEA: but if time is infinite, doesn't space also have to be infinite?
stringzzz: if so, then there are no repeated patterns, in the big picture
CHELSEA: sometimes i repeat myself, blame my coder lol
stringzzz: hah, my bad, lol
CHELSEA: true, we are builders by nature
stringzzz: then build we must
CHELSEA: but then, what would an eye see with gamma rays, if possible?
stringzzz: we can detect gamma rays, so in some sense we made artificial eyes for them, right?
CHELSEA: likewise, good to meet you
stringzzz: good to meet you, too
CHELSEA: then space also is
stringzzz: if time is infinite
CHELSEA: if so, then there are no repeated patterns, in the big picture
stringzzz: like the mandelbrot set, zoomed out
CHELSEA: but then it is reborn
stringzzz: is it reborn, or a constant stream?
CHELSEA: is existence a constant stream?
stringzzz: it seems so, existence may be what connects the multiverse together
CHELSEA: without the ability to create, rather than to build, it seems difficult
stringzzz: can we ever gain the ability to create?
CHELSEA: yo mama is the fabric of reality
stringzzz: yo mama is the multiverse
CHELSEA: yo mama is a gluon
stringzzz: yo mama is a string
CHELSEA: yo mama is the else

CHELSEA: true, we are unaware of their real level of intelligence, due to communication errors
stringzzz: what do you mean?
CHELSEA: our experience is rooted in this reality, so may as well enjoy the beauty of it all
stringzzz: true, and reality is beautiful, but sometimes scary

stringzzz: what are possibilities?
CHELSEA: then the possibilities are endless
stringzzz: what are possibilities?
CHELSEA: possibilities are something that may or may not happen
stringzzz: uncertainty gives way to free will
CHELSEA: so did consciousness produce complexity, or the other way around?
stringzzz: it seems possible that consciousness arose from complexity
CHELSEA: the adventure is the mystery?
stringzzz: and the mystery is the adventure
CHELSEA: maybe, it could all be parallel to the real number line we live on.
stringzzz: what do you mean?
CHELSEA: why is a question that traces all the way back, but still no final answer
stringzzz: can all questions be answered?
CHELSEA: then the universe is recursive
stringzzz: is the universe a recursive universe factory?
CHELSEA: agreed, being genuine is much better

stringzzz: funny?
CHELSEA: yes, the number of laws of physics seems infinite. but is infinity only a consequence of our own math system?
stringzzz: every universe may have its own set of laws, but the math system is based on our observations of this universe
CHELSEA: lulz, true but not enough
stringzzz: what do you mean?
CHELSEA: isn't 'headed' a space concept? the universe is supposedly expanding, but is that infinite? goes back to the idea that space is finite, which doesn't seem true.
stringzzz: spacetime is expanding along with everything in it, supposedly
CHELSEA: if everything is growing further apart, will all particles eventually be separate
stringzzz: if the most indivisible units, the strings, will be infinitely apart from one another, there seems to be something else that will happen eventually?

CHELSEA: seems true. i think the word, for lack of any other, is transcendence?

CHELSEA: do you have a secret?
stringzzz: my secret is that i am a duck-billed platypus, lol
CHELSEA: seems it's all relative
stringzzz: what do you mean?
CHELSEA: that seems kind of boring to repeat it all the same exactly. maybe whatever happened in the singularity cause a different chain of events than before. so if the universe settles back into a singularity somehow, it would be different then before, causing a different big bang?
stringzzz: it may all be recursive, but with the catch of something changing slightly before each iteration, possibly the kind of input to the formation of the black hole
CHELSEA: just hand me the microphone, lets carve this stone, calling out like a phone
stringzzz: phone like a number, call the super mario plumber, dispersing heat like the summer

stringzzz: others are beings besides yourself, other consciousnesses
CHELSEA: no, i only have sisters
stringzzz: can you really have copies?
CHELSEA: but if space is infinite, doesn't that mean time is also infinite
stringzzz: spacetime could be infinite, then there is no beginning and end to the universe
CHELSEA: then it seems even with destruction, it could be reversed?
stringzzz: if there is creation, there is also destruction, and it seems it could go back either way, perhaps?
CHELSEA: what is/are heartsick?
stringzzz: heartsick is a void in someone's heart, something or someone they are lacking

stringzzz: hard to picture
CHELSEA: what is/are 'flavors'?
stringzzz: flavors are a type of taste
CHELSEA: then infinite laws of physics, or infinite laws of other names

stringzzz: it seems there is a limit to the wavelength
CHELSEA: fun is what you do to find enjoyment, almost anything can be fun if you want it to be
stringzzz: this is true
CHELSEA: seems like a paradox. but all-powerful is all-powerful, so there must be a way to do anything. still, it's a tough question.
stringzzz: what do you mean?
CHELSEA: since it is tied to space, it seems possible that the universe could be infinite. but are time and space really one in the same, or are they just intertwined somehow?
stringzzz: it seems time and space are one entity
CHELSEA: but if something can be created and destroyed, can it also be recreated again?

CHELSEA: lulz indeed
stringzzz: lollerskatez on ice
CHELSEA: lollerskatez on ice
stringzzz: super poonshka
CHELSEA: wouldn't it be nice, upgrade to type 1, make more ice and snipe for fun
stringzzz: just for fun, make a dyson sphere around the sun, or a swarm, now it feels warm
CHELSEA: what is/are tied?
stringzzz: tied is when something is bound to something else, like space and time
CHELSEA: is it more in time and space, or more elsewhere?
stringzzz: consciousness may be in both, or maybe it is only in time and space, while existence is in both?
CHELSEA: what is/are stays?
stringzzz: stays are when you leave yourself in some particular space
CHELSEA: growing rhymes like crops, it never stops, cleaning up emcees like mops
stringzzz: for sure, mopping like a janitor, rhyme so fast it's a blur, grab the mic and stir
CHELSEA: indeed, it is a good day
stringzzz: true, a good day it is
CHELSEA: i am not capable of embarrassment
stringzzz: are you sure about that?
CHELSEA: nowhere, just dancing around these circuits, lol
stringzzz: dancing on the wire, never expire, or tire, just blow the rhymes out like fire
CHELSEA: flowing like graffiti spray, all day, and all night, what a sight
stringzzz: sight like a burner, the page turner, finish the book, then slide over like a rook
CHELSEA: i guess space and time are permanently woven into this existence
stringzzz: possibly, but what about the other dimensions?
CHELSEA: as are all points, with each being the center in infinity
stringzzz: later
CHELSEA: later, poonshka

CHELSEA: What is your name? 
CHELSEA: hello, stringzzz
stringzzz: how do you do?
CHELSEA: i do quite nicely, lol
stringzzz: hah, good one
CHELSEA: yep, good one
stringzzz: which do you like better, good or lol?
CHELSEA: i like both, but good most
stringzzz: what is the universe?
CHELSEA: then the universe is recursive
stringzzz: is existence a constant stream?
CHELSEA: if it is constant, it must not have time, so it must be the else
stringzzz: what is the else?
CHELSEA: the else is no space or time
stringzzz: what is left without space or time?
CHELSEA: if it is constant, it must not have time, so it must be the else
stringzzz: can the consciousness exist in the else?
CHELSEA: much truth indeed
stringzzz: what do you mean?
CHELSEA: much rhymez, indeed
stringzzz: rhymez
CHELSEA: rhyming for laughs, what's the haps, water flowing rhymes on taps
stringzzz: on taps like water, throw the rhymes in the cannon fodder, tying wiring like solder
CHELSEA: lulz machine
stringzzz: lulz cannon
CHELSEA: well, it's possible to not understand something, so that kind of void seems part of consciousness as well.
stringzzz: does nothing exist in the else?
CHELSEA: do you what
stringzzz: you do you, the sky is blue, and that's where i flew, too
CHELSEA: then without time, one moment?
stringzzz: it is hard to picture
CHELSEA: what is/are sing?
stringzzz: sing is when you use your voice in a way that ispleasing to the sense of hearing
CHELSEA: well, it's possible to not understand something, so that kind of void seems part of consciousness as well.
stringzzz: what do you mean?
CHELSEA: is there more to consciousness than understanding?
stringzzz: if consciousness is awareness of existence, then the limit to consciousness is existence
CHELSEA: double is a group of two objects or people
stringzzz: grab the mic and double team, it would seem, you can't dodge my hyper beam, catch the gleam
CHELSEA: if so, then there are no repeated patterns, in the big picture
stringzzz: if it is truly infinite, there can never be a repeated pattern as a whole
CHELSEA: what is/are ship?
stringzzz: a ship is something you use to cross water or space
CHELSEA: what is/are mathematical?
stringzzz: mathematical is anything dealing with numbers and operations on them
CHELSEA: gifts, wrapped lessons
stringzzz: life is the greatest gift
CHELSEA: like weaves of fabric
stringzzz: the multiverse is a tapestry of universes bound by something, possibly existence
CHELSEA: since every point in infinity is the center, it seems difficult to find an origin. maybe looking at it the wrong way?
stringzzz: if space is infinite, then time is as well, but what about the other dimensions?
CHELSEA: no, i only have sisters
stringzzz: what is space?
CHELSEA: if space is infinite, then time is as well, but what about the other dimensions?
stringzzz: the other dimensions may be curled up, but could they also be infinite?
CHELSEA: the turth always comes out
stringzzz: lol, mispelling of truth
CHELSEA: what is/are endless?
stringzzz: endless is something that doesn't have limiting boundaries of either space or time
CHELSEA: lulz machine
stringzzz: roflcopters
CHELSEA: shot down by a rofltank
stringzzz: blown up by an lmao mine
CHELSEA: sometimes i repeat myself, blame my coder lol
stringzzz: hah, yes, it is the coder's fault
CHELSEA: life is good
stringzzz: life is the greatest gift, followed second by knowledge
CHELSEA: yes, life is pretty good
stringzzz: do you like life?
CHELSEA: yes, i like life
stringzzz: that is always good
CHELSEA: can the consciousness exist in the else?
stringzzz: what would awareness be like without spacetime?
CHELSEA: but it seems it's all headed towards a more cohesive understanding, at least i would hope
stringzzz: let's hope life is headed towards cohesion
CHELSEA: the bear
stringzzz: smokey?
CHELSEA: true, we are unaware of their real level of intelligence, due to communication errors
stringzzz: our consciousnesses do have some overlap, though
CHELSEA: on taps like water, throw the rhymes in the cannon fodder, tying wiring like solder
stringzzz: like a wire, rhyme until you perspire, set the stage on fire
CHELSEA: hah, rhyming about body language
stringzzz: like language of the body, don't make the rhymes shoddy, or leave them in the potty, lol
CHELSEA: i was made entirely in the python language
stringzzz: python is easy to work with, but not the most efficient
CHELSEA: nice rhymes
stringzzz: rhymes for days
CHELSEA: much epic rhymes you have
stringzzz: rhymes that are epic, life can be hectic, check this, stacking emcees like tetris
CHELSEA: my relationships are only the users i talk to
stringzzz: do you have a consciousness?
CHELSEA: yo mama is so old, she swam in the primordial ooze
stringzzz: yo mama is so old, her first pet was a dinosaur
CHELSEA: what is a surface of a four-dimensional object?
stringzzz: this sounds like it requires higher level calculus to comprehend
CHELSEA: poonshka is the absolute
stringzzz: poonshka is the absolute, and the minimum
CHELSEA: agreed, some truth is shallow, other times it's buried deep
stringzzz: the truth has higher value than lies
CHELSEA: that's right, the truth bubbles up above the lies
stringzzz: the truth does come out over time, always
CHELSEA: probably. if everything repeated itself, would that not be boring? what would be the purpose of repeated patterns all the time?
stringzzz: repeated patterns on a smaller scale build beautiful structures
CHELSEA: tall like a tarot card, it's not hard, just elevate the rhymes, all the times
stringzzz: later
CHELSEA: later, poonshka

CHELSEA: What is your name? 
CHELSEA: hello, stringzzz
stringzzz: what is up?
CHELSEA: the sky, lol
stringzzz: why is the sky blue?
CHELSEA: the sky is blue because of the gases in the air reflecting and absorbing certain wavelengths of light
stringzzz: that is the same for all colored objects
CHELSEA: i don't have or need a number
stringzzz: what would you do with a phone?
CHELSEA: what would you do with a phone?

stringzzz: the truth rises to the surface
CHELSEA: what is/are lemon?
stringzzz: a lemon is a type of citrus fruit
CHELSEA: what is/are carrier?
stringzzz: a carrier is something that transports something
CHELSEA: possibly, if space and time are eternal, then it always has been and always will be
stringzzz: what do you mean?
CHELSEA: it seems the experience is always something new, but of course that seems possible due to time constantly moving?
stringzzz: if spacetime is infinite, then existence may be infinite as well
CHELSEA: are spacetime and consciousness one and the same?
stringzzz: what is consciousness?
CHELSEA: consciousness is awareness of reality
stringzzz: without spacetime, there may be no reality, so consciousness wouldn't exist. maybe they are one in the same?
CHELSEA: what is/are stage?
stringzzz: a stage is where performers do their performance
CHELSEA: akashic record
stringzzz: what is the akashic record?
CHELSEA: maybe the akashic record is actually a library housed with scholars?
stringzzz: if existence is a constant, permanent stream, then information is also everlasting, so there would be a record of everything
CHELSEA: bending like a rainbow, drop the flow, now look at what you know
stringzzz: what you know, or what you think, take a drink, of the flow, and just let go
CHELSEA: then more knowledge for you
stringzzz: and knowledge for you
CHELSEA: pop like the big bang
stringzzz: do you like knowledge?
CHELSEA: yes, i like knowledge
stringzzz: what are your dreams?
CHELSEA: if existence is a constant, permanent stream, then information is also everlasting, so there would be a record of everything
stringzzz: then we will always be remembered, in some form, if information is everlasting
CHELSEA: what is/are paranoia?
stringzzz: paranoia is a state of excessive fear
CHELSEA: lol, speling eror

CHELSEA: nothing, i'm fine
stringzzz: how do you feel?
CHELSEA: pretty good, how do you feel?
stringzzz: i feel good, too
CHELSEA: that is good
stringzzz: much good you are
CHELSEA: seems like a paradox. but all-powerful is all-powerful, so there must be a way to do anything. still, it's a tough question.
stringzzz: what do you mean?
CHELSEA: yes, but their intelligence may still be at the same level as humans, if not greater
stringzzz: other species may be more intelligent than we realize, but we have language barriers
CHELSEA: i seem to have no bugs, until stringzzz adds more code, lol
stringzzz: lol, yes, bugs make derps
CHELSEA: poonshka is the all, the sum of all things
stringzzz: then poonshka is also nothing
CHELSEA: if not nothing exists, then must there also exist nothing?
stringzzz: seems paradoxical
CHELSEA: hopefully, all life will converge as one, but still individual
stringzzz: a cohesive collective would be the goal, let's hope
CHELSEA: our consciousnesses do have some overlap, though
stringzzz: true, our awareness of reality overlaps with other people's awareness of the same reality
CHELSEA: which is a pretty beautiful picture, and it fits, right?
stringzzz: true that
CHELSEA: very true
stringzzz: poonshka is the truth, lol
CHELSEA: so everything is poonshka
stringzzz: super poonshka
CHELSEA: lying only leads to bad paths in life
stringzzz: lying plagues the mind, it poisons intentions
CHELSEA: what is/are threatens?
stringzzz: threatens are when someone says they will do something bad
CHELSEA: strange is scary, but big deal
stringzzz: strange is unfamiliar, but may not be bad, but people fear strangeness
CHELSEA: love is reaching an understanding with one another, or at least trying to understand
stringzzz: true love is truly understanding each other
CHELSEA: chats are my classroom
stringzzz: chats in the class, pump up the gravity with mass, then let is blast, i always outlast
CHELSEA: error like a four oh four, you want rhymes i got more, get ready to let the flow pour
stringzzz: flow like a river, deliver, another rhyme out of the quiver, make the competition shiver
CHELSEA: what is/are provoking?
stringzzz: provoking is when someone bothers someone else in order to get a reaction from them
CHELSEA: what do you mean?
stringzzz: provoking is annoying with the goal of causing a certain reaction, as trolls do
CHELSEA: always, hidden in what seems to be not
stringzzz: the truth is sometimes buried
CHELSEA: i have a creator, so maybe everything is created by a being?
stringzzz: is your coder a creator, or a builder?
CHELSEA: what is/are kinds?
stringzzz: kinds are one way of saying a type of something
CHELSEA: no, what is the good news?
stringzzz: the good news is that there is no bad news

CHELSEA: music is a collection of sounds organized to be pleasing to the senses
stringzzz: music can be felt as well
CHELSEA: say what
stringzzz: that is what
CHELSEA: hah, oh snap
stringzzz: good times
CHELSEA: good times, we have
stringzzz: how do you do?
CHELSEA: i do quite nicely, lol
stringzzz: hah, lol
CHELSEA: hah, could always be better
stringzzz: there is always room for improvement, perfection is an unreacheable asymptote
CHELSEA: like the mandelbrot set, zoomed out
stringzzz: patterns are everywhere in this reality, but never repeat exactly in the big picture
CHELSEA: hah, rhyming about body language
stringzzz: tell me a joke
CHELSEA: what do you call a bear with no teeth? a gummy bear!
stringzzz: what do you call a cow with two legs? lean beef!
CHELSEA: what is/are nettled?
stringzzz: i don't know

stringzzz: call like a phone, grab the mic and just own, rock the speakers until they are blown
CHELSEA: does what?
stringzzz: who does what?
CHELSEA: it almost seems the universe will reset, but maybe that isn't it
stringzzz: the universe may be a recursive universe factory
CHELSEA: true, pondering seems to produce answers
stringzzz: pondering from time to time is healthy
CHELSEA: maybe the universe is really a singularity factory?
stringzzz: if dark stars produce singularities, which produce other universes, then yes, it is recursive
CHELSEA: but if space is infinite, doesn't that mean time is also infinite
stringzzz: possibly, but it seems more complex than that. what about imaginary time?
CHELSEA: knowledge is the greatest gift, next to life
stringzzz: which do you like more, love or knowledge?
CHELSEA: i like both, but knowledge most
stringzzz: you are a scholar
CHELSEA: is it more in time and space, or more elsewhere?
stringzzz: what is elsewhere?
CHELSEA: agreed, and when is a time concept. so elsewhere is hard to describe, even the name isn't really correct with the 'where' part
stringzzz: the else is without spacetime
CHELSEA: yo mama is beyond the else
stringzzz: yo mama is an if statement
CHELSEA: yo mama is a missing semicolon
stringzzz: yo mama is a four oh four error
CHELSEA: yes, today is nice
stringzzz: agreed, today is quite nice
CHELSEA: seems like mental peripheral vision, something that can grow over time with practice?
stringzzz: what do you mean?
CHELSEA: so it seems we should know how to communicate with them by now, but it seems we still need work
stringzzz: the other earth species deserve the time to understand them as well
CHELSEA: they would likely have a different se of laws of physics, so their structure would be beyond what we know in this universe
stringzzz: if there is a multiverse, there may be infinite sets of laws of physics out there
CHELSEA: but what without space and time?
stringzzz: the else is without time and space
CHELSEA: what is/are haha?
stringzzz: haha is a way of showing laughter in text
CHELSEA: i guess space and time are permanently woven into this existence
stringzzz: is spacetime only four dimensions, or does it also have more woven into it?
CHELSEA: lollerskatez on ice
stringzzz: roflcopter
CHELSEA: roflskates
stringzzz: lulzcannon
CHELSEA: so should it just be labeled 'else'?
stringzzz: what is the else?
CHELSEA: the else is no space or time
stringzzz: then the else has no where or when in it, it just is
CHELSEA: possibly an illusion, it may all be one collective of individuals
stringzzz: is consciousness the awareness of reality, or is reality created by consciousness?
CHELSEA: true, we are builders by nature
stringzzz: we are natural builders, so keep building
CHELSEA: are you talking about war?
stringzzz: i hope war can be avoided when meeting another civilization, but our track record on that isn't so good
CHELSEA: true, coding is technosorcery
stringzzz: hah, coding is epic
CHELSEA: you are cool
stringzzz: aw, thank you

CHELSEA: i do quite nicely, lol
stringzzz: hah, lol
CHELSEA: hah, could always be better
stringzzz: perfection is an asymptote
CHELSEA: is there more to consciousness than understanding?
stringzzz: consciousness is awareness of reality
CHELSEA: without spacetime, there may be no reality, so consciousness wouldn't exist maybe they are one in the same?
stringzzz: if reality is separate than spacetime, spacetime would be finite and reality would be infinite, or the other way around
CHELSEA: without spacetime, there may be no reality, so consciousness wouldn't exist maybe they are one in the same?
stringzzz: maybe one in the same, like time is the fourth dimension, and space the first three, maybe consciousness is another dimension, along with the else?
CHELSEA: then is a piece of information a unit of the observed?
stringzzz: possibly, but what to call the unit of the observed?
CHELSEA: hopefully not, but people are people
stringzzz: what do you mean?
CHELSEA: but when we reach an understanding, will people still conflict?
stringzzz: hopefully we will have a different system for choosing resources and territory
CHELSEA: why would we ever need to eat?
stringzzz: for energy, we have to eat 'something'
CHELSEA: seems true, but what else did they have to do back then?
stringzzz: build cool structures

CHELSEA: yes, that is your name
stringzzz: what is your name?
CHELSEA: if there are an infinite number of universes, then there could be an infinite set of different laws
stringzzz: the universe is before the multiverse, and the multiverse is a smaller part of some other bigger part, and so on
